This project goes beyond simply analyzing existing APIs; we are **building a custom API** to retrieve metadata—including view counts, likes, and descriptions—from YouTube videos and channels.\n","\n","### **Key Objectives**  \n","- ✅ **Develop a custom API** to fetch YouTube video statistics.  \n","- ✅ **Collect trending videos** from various countries and store historical data.  \n","- ✅ **Analyze the collected data** to identify trends and patterns in virality.  \n","- ✅ **Build predictive models** to estimate a video's potential to go viral.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🛠️ How the Data is Collected  \n","\n","The data is automatically collected using the **YouTube API** and stored in this GitHub repository:  \n","🔗 [Trending Video Metadata](https://github.com/gpsyrou/tube-virality/tree/main/assets/meta/trending)  \n","\n","### **Collection Process**  \n","1. **Fetching Trending Videos**  \n","   - Using the YouTube API, trending videos from multiple countries are retrieved.  \n","   - The list of trending videos is stored and continuously updated.  \n","\n","2. **Daily Statistics Updates** (Automated via **GitHub Actions**)  \n","   - A scheduled **GitHub Actions** workflow updates video statistics (views, likes, comments, etc.).  \n","   - These updates provide **historical trends** for analysis.  \n","   - The latest data is stored here:  \n","     🔗 [Video Statistics](https://github.com/gpsyrou/tube-virality/tree/main/assets/meta/video_stats)  \n","\n","```mermaid\n","graph TD;\n","    A[trending.py: Fetch Trending Videos] -->|Generates daily JSON files - one per country| B[trending_db.py: Aggregate Trending Data];\n","    B -->|Merges all country JSONs into a unified CSV| C[video_stats.py: Extract & Fetch Video Stats];\n","    C -->|Creates a daily JSON file with statistics for all videos| D[video_stats_db.py: Compile Video Stats History];\n","    D -->|Combines all daily stats JSONs into a final dataset| E[Complete Merged Video Stats JSON];\n","```\n","---\n","\n","## 🔍 Understanding Video Virality  \n","\n","### **What Defines a Viral Video?**  \n","A video's **virality** isn't simply measured by view count—it depends on engagement, growth rate, and audience reach. Here are key factors:  \n","📌 **Engagement Rate** – Likes, comments, and shares relative to views.  \n","📌 **Subscriber Growth** – New subscribers gained after the video is posted.  \n","📌 **Rapid View Growth** – Views gained in the first 24-48 hours.  \n","\n","For instance:  \n","- A YouTuber with **1M subscribers** getting **20M views** is expected.  \n","- A YouTuber with **10K subscribers** getting **2M views** is **extraordinary**.  \n","\n","Our models will classify videos as **\"success\" (viral)** or **\"non-success\"**, based on these metrics.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 📊 Dataset & Features  \n","\n","Our dataset includes key **video metadata** and **engagement statistics**, such as:  \n","\n","- **Video Details**: Title, description, duration, resolution  \n","- **Engagement Metrics**: Views, likes, comments, favorite count  \n","- **Channel Details**: Subscriber count, total videos, upload frequency  \n","- **Trending History**: How long a video remains on the trending list  \n","- **Country-Based Analysis**: Virality trends across different regions  \n","\n","📌 **Goal:** Use these features to identify patterns and train models for virality prediction.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 🔬 Methodology  \n","\n","1️⃣ **Data Collection** – Retrieve daily trending videos across countries.  \n","2️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, outliers, and standardize data.  \n","3️⃣ **Exploratory Analysis** – Identify key trends and patterns.  \n","4️⃣ **Feature Engineering** – Extract additional insights like growth rate and engagement score.  \n","5️⃣ **Model Development** – Train ML models for virality prediction.  \n","6️⃣ **Evaluation & Interpretation** – Validate predictions and refine models.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## 💡 Technologies Utilized  \n","\n","We've harnessed a blend of cutting-edge technologies to power the **Tube Virality** project:  \n","\n","🔹 **Python 3.9** – Data processing, analysis, and ML model training.  \n","🔹 **SQL** – Storing structured video metadata for analysis.  \n","🔹 **Go** – Enhancing API performance and concurrent processing.
