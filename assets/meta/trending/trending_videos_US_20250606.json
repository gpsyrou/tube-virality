Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award\u00ae nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz\u2019s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar\u00ae winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda\u2019s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba\u2019s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars\u00ae for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar\u00ae winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

                "description": "The Pacers defeated the Thunder, 111-110 tonight in Oklahoma City. Pascal Siakam led the way for the Pacers with 19 points on 7-15 from the field (1-2 from 3) to go along with 10 rebounds and 3 assists. For the Thunder, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a team-high 38 points on 14-30 from the field (3-6 from 3). The Pacers lead the series 1-0.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers mounted an incredible comeback in the 4th quarter, at one point down 15 points, they managed to rally back and in the end it was Tyrese Haliburton who once again put the team ahead late! This is the FIFTH time this postseason that the Pacers have rallied from a 15+ point deficit, which is the MOST by any team in the playoffs since 1998! They also have become just the third team in NBA Playoffs history to rally from a 15 point deficit in the 4th quarter, joining the 2011 Dallas Mavericks and the 1992 Chicago Bulls. Haliburton's shot to put the team ahead with 0.3 seconds remaining put Tyrese in the history books, as that marks the FIFTH time this playoff run where he has made a go-ahead, game-winning or game-tying shot within the last 30 seconds of the 4th quarter or in overtime, the most of ANY player in NBA Playoff history! The record was formerly held by Ray Allen in his 2009 run, with four made shots of that variety.\n\nNever miss a moment with the latest news, trending stories and highlights to bring you closer to your favorite players and teams.\nDownload now \u27a1 https://nba.smart.link/NBAApp-YTDes\n\nSubscribe to the NBA: https://on.nba.com/2JX5gSN",

The Pacers lead the series 1-0.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers mounted an incredible comeback in the 4th quarter, at one point down 15 points, they managed to rally back and in the end it was Tyrese Haliburton who once again put the team ahead late! This is the FIFTH time this postseason that the Pacers have rallied from a 15+ point deficit, which is the MOST by any team in the playoffs since 1998! They also have become just the third team in NBA Playoffs history to rally from a 15 point deficit in the 4th quarter, joining the 2011 Dallas Mavericks and the 1992 Chicago Bulls. Haliburton's shot to put the team ahead with 0.3 seconds remaining put Tyrese in the history books, as that marks the FIFTH time this playoff run where he has made a go-ahead, game-winning or game-tying shot within the last 30 seconds of the 4th quarter or in overtime, the most of ANY player in NBA Playoff history! The record was formerly held by Ray Allen in his 2009 run, with four made shots of that variety.\n\nNever miss a moment with the latest news, trending stories and highlights to bring you closer to your favorite players and teams.\nDownload now \u27a1 https://nba.smart.link/NBAApp-YTDes\n\nSubscribe to the NBA: https://on.nba.com/2JX5gSN"

It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture.

It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"
