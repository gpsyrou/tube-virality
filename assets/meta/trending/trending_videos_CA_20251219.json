Disclosure Day is in theaters 06.12.26.\n\nIf you found out we weren\u2019t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. \nWe are coming close to \u2026 Disclosure Day. \n\nUniversal Pictures is proud to release a new original event film created and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars SAG winner and Oscar\u00ae nominee Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place), Emmy and Golden Globe winner Josh O\u2019Connor (Challengers, The Crown), Oscar\u00ae winner Colin Firth (The King\u2019s Speech, Kingsman franchise), Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) and two-time Oscar\u00ae nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nBased on a story by Spielberg, the screenplay is by David Koepp, whose previous work with Spielberg includes the scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Combined, those films earned more than $3 billion worldwide. Koepp also wrote the script for this 2025\u2019s Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nDisclosure Day is produced by five-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (The Fabelmans, West Side Story) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. \n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the industry\u2019s most successful and influential filmmakers. The top-grossing director of all time, Spielberg has helmed such blockbusters as Jaws, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park. \n \nAmong his myriad honors, he is a three-time Academy Award\u00ae winner, including Oscars\u00ae for Best Director and Best Picture for Schindler\u2019s List, which received a total of seven Oscars\u00ae, and for Best Director for Saving Private Ryan. His most recent film, The Fabelmans, was released by Universal in 2022 and received seven Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including for Directing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture. \n\nWebsite: http://disclosuredaymovie.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/disclosuredayfilm/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disclosureday/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en\nX: https://x.com/disclosureday\nHashtag: #DisclosureDay",

How much you wanna risk?\"\nI'm not lookin' for somebody with some superhuman gifts\nSome superhero, some fairytale bliss\nJust something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss\nI want something just like this\nDoo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo, doo, doo\nDoo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo\nOh, I want something just like this\nDoo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo\nDoo-doo-doo, doo, doo\nDoo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo\nOh, I want something just like this\nI want something just like this\nI've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths\nThe testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse\nAnd Superman unrolls a suit before he lifts\nBut I'm not the kind of person that it fits\nShe said, \"Where d'you wanna go?

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Though they emerged in a place and time where trippy psychedelic visions were the order of\u202fthe day, CCR bucked the trends and instead tapped into a rich, traditional seam of American music that connected to blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, folk and R&B.\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\nDuring their short time together as a band (1968 \u2013 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity lead by singer, songwriter, arranger John Fogerty. They\u2019ve sold close to 100 million records, releasing 14 Top 10 hits. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook. Fogerty penned songs like \u201cBad Moon Rising,\u201d \u201cDown on the Corner,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son,\u201d \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain,\u201d \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cBorn on the Bayou,\u201d \u201cTravelin\u2019 Band\u201d and \u201cUp Around the Bend\u201d have been ingrained into pop culture \u2014 not just as rock staples, but as classic standards.\n\nWith so many memorable songs that continue to grace our radio waves, television and movie screens, plus lyrics that still resonate today, Creedence Clearwater Revival is, truly, America\u2019s greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band.\n\n#ccr #creedenceclearwaterrevival #grapevine",

Though they emerged in a place and time where trippy psychedelic visions were the order of\u202fthe day, CCR bucked the trends and instead tapped into a rich, traditional seam of American music that connected to blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, folk and R&B.\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\nDuring their short time together as a band (1968 \u2013 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity lead by singer, songwriter, arranger John Fogerty. They\u2019ve sold close to 100 million records, releasing 14 Top 10 hits. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook. Fogerty penned songs like \u201cBad Moon Rising,\u201d \u201cDown on the Corner,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son,\u201d \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain,\u201d \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cBorn on the Bayou,\u201d \u201cTravelin\u2019 Band\u201d and \u201cUp Around the Bend\u201d have been ingrained into pop culture \u2014 not just as rock staples, but as classic standards.\n\nWith so many memorable songs that continue to grace our radio waves, television and movie screens, plus lyrics that still resonate today, Creedence Clearwater Revival is, truly, America\u2019s greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band.\n\n#ccr #creedenceclearwaterrevival #grapevine"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
