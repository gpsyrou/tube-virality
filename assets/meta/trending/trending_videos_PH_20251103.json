Keri Hilson\n\n[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson]\nWeak, I have been crying and crying for weeks\nHow'd I survive when I could barely speak\nBarely eat, on my knees?\nBut that's the moment you came to me\nI don't know what your love has done to me\nThink I'm invincible I see through the me I used to be\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson, Both]\nYou changed my whole life\nDon't know what you're doing to me with your love\nI'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me (Oh)\nA superhuman heart beats in me\nNothing can stop me here with you\nSuperhuman\nI feel so superhuman, superhuman\nI feel so superhuman, superhuman\n\n[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson]\nStrong, since I've been flying and righting the wrongs\nFeels almost like I had it all along, I can see tomorrow\nBut every problem is gone because\nI flew everywhere with love inside of me\nIt's unbelievable to see how love could set me free\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson, Both]\nYou changed my whole life\nDon't know what you're doing to me with your love (To me, oh-oh)\nI'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me\nA superhuman heart beats in me\nNothing can stop me here with you\nSuperhuman\nI feel so superhuman, superhuman\nI feel so superhuman\n\n[Bridge: Chris Brown Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]\nIt's not a bird, not a plane\nIt's my heart and it's going, gone away\nMy only weakness is you, only reason is you\nEvery minute with you I feel like I can do anything\nGoing, going I'm gone away in love\n\n[Chorus: Chris Brown, Keri Hilson, Both]\nYou changed my whole life (Oh)\nDon't know what you're doing to me with your love (To me, yeah, yeah)\nI'm feeling all superhuman, you did that to me\nA superhuman heart beats in me (Woah, oh)\nNothing can stop me here with you\nSuperhuman\nSuperhuman\n\n \n\n.........\n\n#chrisbrown #superhuman #lyrics #kerihilson",

Though they emerged in a place and time where trippy psychedelic visions were the order of\u202fthe day, CCR bucked the trends and instead tapped into a rich, traditional seam of American music that connected to blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, folk and R&B.\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\nDuring their short time together as a band (1968 \u2013 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity lead by singer, songwriter, arranger John Fogerty. They\u2019ve sold close to 100 million records, releasing 14 Top 10 hits. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook. Fogerty penned songs like \u201cBad Moon Rising,\u201d \u201cDown on the Corner,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son,\u201d \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain,\u201d \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cBorn on the Bayou,\u201d \u201cTravelin\u2019 Band\u201d and \u201cUp Around the Bend\u201d have been ingrained into pop culture \u2014 not just as rock staples, but as classic standards.\n\nWith so many memorable songs that continue to grace our radio waves, television and movie screens, plus lyrics that still resonate today, Creedence Clearwater Revival is, truly, America\u2019s greatest rock \u2019n\u2019 roll band.\n\n#ccr #creedenceclearwaterrevival #haveyoueverseentherain",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"
