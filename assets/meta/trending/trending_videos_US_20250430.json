                "description": "#truecrimecommunity #drewpeterson \n\nEveryone in Bolingbrook, Illinois thought Sgt. Drew Peterson was just a real solid guy. He once owned a local bar, he was a cop and even had connections to the government. \n\nBut his good guy routine was shattered when his wife turned up dead and his next wife just... disappeared one day. Once people started asking questions and national news outlets got involved... what they uncovered was twisted.\n\nNow... this story first aired as a podcast exclusive. So go check out MMM wherever you get podcasts because, in case you didn't know, there are some episodes over there that you can't find on my YouTube!\n\nBut what this version has the pod exclusive doesn't - cool visuals! I'm talking documents from the investigation, interview footage and courtroom sketches.\n\nSo today... in a special episode I'm calling a Video Pod... we're talking about the shocking story of Drew Peterson: a man who used his badge, reputation, and connections to hide in plain sight. Until he couldn't. \n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to discuss next time. I hope you have a great rest of your week. Make good choices, and I'll be seeing you very soon.\nxo \nBailey Sarian\n\nI sometimes talk about my Good Reads in the show. \nSo here's the link if you want to check it out.

                    "description": "#truecrimecommunity #drewpeterson \n\nEveryone in Bolingbrook, Illinois thought Sgt. Drew Peterson was just a real solid guy. He once owned a local bar, he was a cop and even had connections to the government. \n\nBut his good guy routine was shattered when his wife turned up dead and his next wife just... disappeared one day. Once people started asking questions and national news outlets got involved... what they uncovered was twisted.\n\nNow... this story first aired as a podcast exclusive. So go check out MMM wherever you get podcasts because, in case you didn't know, there are some episodes over there that you can't find on my YouTube!\n\nBut what this version has the pod exclusive doesn't - cool visuals! I'm talking documents from the investigation, interview footage and courtroom sketches.\n\nSo today... in a special episode I'm calling a Video Pod... we're talking about the shocking story of Drew Peterson: a man who used his badge, reputation, and connections to hide in plain sight. Until he couldn't. \n\nAlso, let me know who you want me to discuss next time. I hope you have a great rest of your week. Make good choices, and I'll be seeing you very soon.\nxo \nBailey Sarian\n\nI sometimes talk about my Good Reads in the show. \nSo here's the link if you want to check it out.
