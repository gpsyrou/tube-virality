Disclosure Day is in theaters 12.06.26.\n\nIf you found out we weren\u2019t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. \nWe are coming close to \u2026 Disclosure Day. \n\nUniversal Pictures is proud to release a new original event film created and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars SAG winner and Oscar\u00ae nominee Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place), Emmy and Golden Globe winner Josh O\u2019Connor (Challengers, The Crown), Oscar\u00ae winner Colin Firth (The King\u2019s Speech, Kingsman franchise), Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) and two-time Oscar\u00ae nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nBased on a story by Spielberg, the screenplay is by David Koepp, whose previous work with Spielberg includes the scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Combined, those films earned more than $3 billion worldwide. Koepp also wrote the script for this 2025\u2019s Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nDisclosure Day is produced by five-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (The Fabelmans, West Side Story) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. \n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the industry\u2019s most successful and influential filmmakers. The top-grossing director of all time, Spielberg has helmed such blockbusters as Jaws, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park. \n \nAmong his myriad honors, he is a three-time Academy Award\u00ae winner, including Oscars\u00ae for Best Director and Best Picture for Schindler\u2019s List, which received a total of seven Oscars\u00ae, and for Best Director for Saving Private Ryan. His most recent film, The Fabelmans, was released by Universal in 2022 and received seven Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including for Directing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture.",

Disclosure Day is in theaters 12.06.26.\n\nIf you found out we weren\u2019t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. \nWe are coming close to \u2026 Disclosure Day. \n\nUniversal Pictures is proud to release a new original event film created and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars SAG winner and Oscar\u00ae nominee Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place), Emmy and Golden Globe winner Josh O\u2019Connor (Challengers, The Crown), Oscar\u00ae winner Colin Firth (The King\u2019s Speech, Kingsman franchise), Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) and two-time Oscar\u00ae nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nBased on a story by Spielberg, the screenplay is by David Koepp, whose previous work with Spielberg includes the scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Combined, those films earned more than $3 billion worldwide. Koepp also wrote the script for this 2025\u2019s Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nDisclosure Day is produced by five-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (The Fabelmans, West Side Story) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. \n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the industry\u2019s most successful and influential filmmakers. The top-grossing director of all time, Spielberg has helmed such blockbusters as Jaws, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park. \n \nAmong his myriad honors, he is a three-time Academy Award\u00ae winner, including Oscars\u00ae for Best Director and Best Picture for Schindler\u2019s List, which received a total of seven Oscars\u00ae, and for Best Director for Saving Private Ryan. His most recent film, The Fabelmans, was released by Universal in 2022 and received seven Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including for Directing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture."

As fractures between competing Avengers teams deepen and the boundaries of the multiverse weaken, Doom emerges from Latveria with a conviction that the universe itself is broken, believing that heroism built on loss has failed. The events following Tony Stark\u2019s death ripple outward, drawing in Reed Richards, Peter Parker, and the Fantastic Four, whose attempt to confront Doom\u2019s designs challenges the natural order of life and death. With the multiverse under strain, Doom\u2019s vision of reshaping reality collides with the moral consequences of undoing sacrifice, setting him on an inevitable path toward conflict with the very ideals that once saved existence. The trailer positions Doomsday as a measured, character-driven confrontation that reframes heroism, power, and consequence, laying the foundation for a larger reckoning that will culminate in Secret Wars.\n\n\u2014  Subscribe to Teaser Universe \ud83c\udfac\n\u2014  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com \ud83d\udce9\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr",

Thank you for your support \u2014 now let\u2019s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. \ud83c\udfac\u2728\n\n\u2014 In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story frames the beginning of the Multiverse Saga\u2019s end by positioning Victor Von Doom as a philosophical and existential counter to the Avengers\u2019 legacy of sacrifice. As fractures between competing Avengers teams deepen and the boundaries of the multiverse weaken, Doom emerges from Latveria with a conviction that the universe itself is broken, believing that heroism built on loss has failed. The events following Tony Stark\u2019s death ripple outward, drawing in Reed Richards, Peter Parker, and the Fantastic Four, whose attempt to confront Doom\u2019s designs challenges the natural order of life and death. With the multiverse under strain, Doom\u2019s vision of reshaping reality collides with the moral consequences of undoing sacrifice, setting him on an inevitable path toward conflict with the very ideals that once saved existence. The trailer positions Doomsday as a measured, character-driven confrontation that reframes heroism, power, and consequence, laying the foundation for a larger reckoning that will culminate in Secret Wars.\n\n\u2014  Subscribe to Teaser Universe \ud83c\udfac\n\u2014  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com \ud83d\udce9\n\n#doomsday #marvel #robertdowneyjr"
