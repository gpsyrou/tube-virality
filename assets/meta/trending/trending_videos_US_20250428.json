                "description": "I finally connected my three giant ecosystem vivariums together, and the result was unbelievable. My long term plan had come to completion when my rainforest floor vivarium, canopy vivarium, and tropical wetlands vivarium became a single space, with shared animals freely able to cross over to the different habitats. I was shocked at what animals crossed over through the new cave tunnel bridge. Our rainforest ecosystem within glass has been forever changed. Hope you enjoy the Season 4 Finale of my Ecosystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever!

My long term plan had come to completion when my rainforest floor vivarium, canopy vivarium, and tropical wetlands vivarium became a single space, with shared animals freely able to cross over to the different habitats.

In May 2022 as part of a complex RICO case, Georgia prosecutors alleged that Young Thug\u2014in addition to being the head of a record label, YSL\u2014was also the leader of a gang of the same name. What followed was the longest criminal trial in Georgia history. \r\n\r\nSince getting out, Young Thug has mostly laid low, to the point of sometimes wearing a mask in public. He has not said much about the last few years of his life, or about anything at all, really\u2026 until now. This is the _GQ_ Video Covery Story with Young Thug.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDirector: Cole Evelev\r\nDirector of Photography: Carter Ross\r\nEditor: Robby Massey\r\nTalent: Young Thug; Zach Baron\r\nProducer: Sam Dennis\r\nLine Producer: Jen Santos\r\nProduction Manager: James Pipitone\r\nProduction Coordinator: Elizabeth Hymes\r\nTalent Booker: Tracy Shaffer\r\nSteadicam Operator: Greg Gustafson\r\nCamera Operator: Jon Corum; Taylor Frontier\r\n1st Assistant Camera: Adam Lee\r\n2nd Assistant Camera: Jacob Mariani\r\nGaffer: Noah Spiece\r\nKey Grip: Jack Motter\r\nSwing: Kevin Shum\r\nDIT: Lauren Worona\r\nSound Mixer: Justin Fox\r\nProduction Assistant: Spencer Mathesen; Lily Starck\r\nMake-up Artist: Hee Soo Kwon\r\nHairstylist: Christy Ivory\r\nProduction Designer: Cedar Jocks\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Jess Dunn\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Rachel Kim\r\nSupervising Editor: Rob Lombardi\r\nAssistant Editor: Fynn Lithgow\n\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to GQ on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/2iij5wt\r\nSubscribe to GQ magazine and get rare swag: https://bit.ly/2xNBH3i\r\nJoin the GQ Discord to talk men's fashion, watches, and more: https://discord.gg/gqmagazine\r\n\r\nABOUT GQ\r\nFor more than 50 years, GQ has been the premier men\u2019s magazine, providing definitive coverage of style, culture, politics and more.

                    "description": "\u201cI love people so much to the point that, the only thing that will make me not love you anymore is betrayal,\u201d says Young Thug as he towers over _GQ\u2019s_ Zach Baron in a perfectly landscaped garden, which sits next to an eccentric taxidermy-filled mansion on the East Side of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nIn October of last year, the rapper Young Thug walked free from the Fulton County jail in Atlanta, concluding one of the strangest and most fraught spectacles in modern music. In May 2022 as part of a complex RICO case, Georgia prosecutors alleged that Young Thug\u2014in addition to being the head of a record label, YSL\u2014was also the leader of a gang of the same name. What followed was the longest criminal trial in Georgia history. \r\n\r\nSince getting out, Young Thug has mostly laid low, to the point of sometimes wearing a mask in public. He has not said much about the last few years of his life, or about anything at all, really\u2026 until now. This is the _GQ_ Video Covery Story with Young Thug.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDirector: Cole Evelev\r\nDirector of Photography: Carter Ross\r\nEditor: Robby Massey\r\nTalent: Young Thug; Zach Baron\r\nProducer: Sam Dennis\r\nLine Producer: Jen Santos\r\nProduction Manager: James Pipitone\r\nProduction Coordinator: Elizabeth Hymes\r\nTalent Booker: Tracy Shaffer\r\nSteadicam Operator: Greg Gustafson\r\nCamera Operator: Jon Corum; Taylor Frontier\r\n1st Assistant Camera: Adam Lee\r\n2nd Assistant Camera: Jacob Mariani\r\nGaffer: Noah Spiece\r\nKey Grip: Jack Motter\r\nSwing: Kevin Shum\r\nDIT: Lauren Worona\r\nSound Mixer: Justin Fox\r\nProduction Assistant: Spencer Mathesen; Lily Starck\r\nMake-up Artist: Hee Soo Kwon\r\nHairstylist: Christy Ivory\r\nProduction Designer: Cedar Jocks\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Jess Dunn\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Rachel Kim\r\nSupervising Editor: Rob Lombardi\r\nAssistant Editor: Fynn Lithgow\n\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to GQ on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/2iij5wt\r\nSubscribe to GQ magazine and get rare swag: https://bit.ly/2xNBH3i\r\nJoin the GQ Discord to talk men's fashion, watches, and more: https://discord.gg/gqmagazine\r\n\r\nABOUT GQ\r\nFor more than 50 years, GQ has been the premier men\u2019s magazine, providing definitive coverage of style, culture, politics and more.
