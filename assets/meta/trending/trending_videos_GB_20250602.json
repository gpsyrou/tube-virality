                "description": "In his ring return, Charlo dominated throughout, showing off his trademark jab early and often (44 total jabs landed), while peppering in straight right hands and left hooks off his signature punch. Charlo scored his first of three knockdowns in round three, hurting LaManna with a straight right before sending him down with a left hook.\n \nThe Houston-native struck again in round four, landing another left hook that forced LaManna to buckle and take a knee. While referee Mark Nelson originally ruled no knockdown, that decision was overturned on video review between rounds.\n \nCharlo returned to his dominance in the fifth frame, this time delivering a laser right hand that put LaManna down for the third time. Although LaManna was able to make it to the bell, he was worse for wear, leading to the referee stopping the bout on advice from the ringside physician.  \n \n\"I'm just looking to stay well-known and relevant,\u201d said Charlo. \u201cNo more dark places and keep my head straight. I just want to encourage everyone in the world, keep God first, keep God first.\u201d\n \n\"It is what it is, I did the best I could,\u201d said LaManna. \u201cThe doctors are here for a reason and they made their decision. I'm disappointed, but it's boxing\u2026Charlo was sharper than I expected. I expected him to come out guns blazing a little more. He's a two-time world champion for a reason.

                "description": "In a spectacular military and propganda coup, Ukraine has carried out an audacious attack on Russia\u2019s airforce, using drones to destroy as many as 40 warplanes at military bases across the country.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called \"Spider's Web\" operation by the SBU security service.  They were smuggled into Russia hidden in wooden mobile cabins, moved close to the airbases, then launched by remote control.  Ukrainian sources told BBC News it had taken 18 months to plan and carry out the operation. \n\nRussia confirmed the Ukrainian attacks, calling them a \"terrorist act\".   Ukraine claims it caused $7bn in damage and destroyed many of Russia\u2019s strategic bomber aircraft. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Paul Adams and Ellie Price.

                    "description": "In a spectacular military and propganda coup, Ukraine has carried out an audacious attack on Russia\u2019s airforce, using drones to destroy as many as 40 warplanes at military bases across the country.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called \"Spider's Web\" operation by the SBU security service.  They were smuggled into Russia hidden in wooden mobile cabins, moved close to the airbases, then launched by remote control.  Ukrainian sources told BBC News it had taken 18 months to plan and carry out the operation. \n\nRussia confirmed the Ukrainian attacks, calling them a \"terrorist act\".   Ukraine claims it caused $7bn in damage and destroyed many of Russia\u2019s strategic bomber aircraft. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Paul Adams and Ellie Price.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling!
