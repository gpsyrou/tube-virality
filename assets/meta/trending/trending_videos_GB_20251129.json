We're all hoping for some of the best games of all time and the best games ever made with the new Switch 2 games but we're also likely going to get some of the worst games of all time and even perhaps the worst games ever made with this Nintendo new console leak. Join Caddy through a documentary video, and not a Nintendo documentary exploring Nintendo history documentary, but specifically looking into the history and legacy of frame rates. What is a frame rate and what is the best frame rate possible - I don't know - but hopefully we can all answer what is frame rate and what is a frame rate while exploring frame rates explained, or frame rate explained - which Caddy has gone out of his way to do. There will be Nintendo mini games and not even in a Top 10 Nintendo format, we will be looking at one of everyone's new favorite games for this console. Going from Louis Le Prince and Roundhay Garden Scene to Switch 2 Welcome Tour gameplay with Guess the Frame Rate, going from the first film ever made or the earliest film ever made all the way to Switch 2 Welcome Tour all minigames and Nintendo minigames - get ready to be amazed and saddened by the story of the history of video cameras with a new mockumentary mixed with Switch 2 Welcome Tour all stamps and testing your knowledge with Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour final quiz - don't come to here for any of the Welcome Tour quiz answers though because you won't get anything - but you will know all about frame rates, especially for the Switch 2 frame rate and Switch 2 refresh rate, and then top it off with the new information that the Switch 2 Joy Cons have a new mouse mode with the Switch 2 Joycons new mouse mode. And don't forget that I'm friends with Scott the Woz on Nintendo Online and you aren't.\n\n\nPATREON (early videos, no ads, credits\u2026) = http://www.patreon.com/caddicarus \nTWITCH = http://www.twitch.tv/Caddicarus\nINSTAGRAM = http://www.instagram.com/caddicarus\nTIKTOK = https://www.tiktok.com/@caddicarus\nLETTERBOXD MOVIE REVIEWS = http://www.letterboxd.com/Caddicarus\nTWITTER = http://www.twitter.com/Caddicarus\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews and Nintendo games like my Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour review for the Nintendo Switch 2 on my channel...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#nintendo #nintendoswitch2 #nintendoswitch #caddicarus #switch2",

Please make sure you watch in the correct frame rate. \u2728\u2728 GET THE LIMITED BRAND-NEW DVD VERSION OF MY 2022 BLU RAY BOX SET RIGHT HERE = http://pixelempire.com/caddy , along with all of the PS1 box art parodies and poster! \u2728\u2728\n\nSpecial thanks for this video specifically to...\n@Xploshi for the custom theme song variant, @DeadwingDork for the minigames jingle, @AntDude92  and @PeanutButterGamer for their cameos (and Ant again for the Popeye Switch footage), @DidYouKnowGamin's Greg and Dazz for custom DYKGaming intro assets and voice-over cameo (and Greg again for the After Effects help on the Crash face melting scene), @ChannelPup for photoshop assistance (the tower-less NYC skyline and me glued to my bride), The Camera Museum, The Framing Workshop and Oakwood Hall for allowing us to film on location, and i4 Studios in Leeds for the last-minute green screen studio hire while we were up north.\n\n\nWritten, performed and edited entirely by Jim Caddick - with ongoing thanks to... @OllyRoss for filming, @TeeLopes for the intro theme song arrangement, Crisppyboat for the intro video and logo branding (https://twitter.com/CrisppyBoat), Cerys Macaky for her costume/makeup/prop assistance and JetPackBraggin for all of my thumbnails (https://www.twitch.tv/JetPackBraggin).\n\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 had one of those new Switch 2 games called Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, aiming to be the response to Sony's PlayStation 5 games like Astro's Playroom PS5 and Astro Bot PS5 - not because of all the Astro Bot PS5 all easter eggs and Nintendo easter eggs and Nintendo references, but because Welcome Tour review goes out of its way to show everyone with Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour gameplay every new feature of the Switch 2 - which were mostly already shown in the Nintendo Direct Switch 2 reveal and Switch 2 console trailer, but now we have a new Switch 2 game review to play in order to see it for ourselves. We're all hoping for some of the best games of all time and the best games ever made with the new Switch 2 games but we're also likely going to get some of the worst games of all time and even perhaps the worst games ever made with this Nintendo new console leak. Join Caddy through a documentary video, and not a Nintendo documentary exploring Nintendo history documentary, but specifically looking into the history and legacy of frame rates. What is a frame rate and what is the best frame rate possible - I don't know - but hopefully we can all answer what is frame rate and what is a frame rate while exploring frame rates explained, or frame rate explained - which Caddy has gone out of his way to do. There will be Nintendo mini games and not even in a Top 10 Nintendo format, we will be looking at one of everyone's new favorite games for this console. Going from Louis Le Prince and Roundhay Garden Scene to Switch 2 Welcome Tour gameplay with Guess the Frame Rate, going from the first film ever made or the earliest film ever made all the way to Switch 2 Welcome Tour all minigames and Nintendo minigames - get ready to be amazed and saddened by the story of the history of video cameras with a new mockumentary mixed with Switch 2 Welcome Tour all stamps and testing your knowledge with Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour final quiz - don't come to here for any of the Welcome Tour quiz answers though because you won't get anything - but you will know all about frame rates, especially for the Switch 2 frame rate and Switch 2 refresh rate, and then top it off with the new information that the Switch 2 Joy Cons have a new mouse mode with the Switch 2 Joycons new mouse mode. And don't forget that I'm friends with Scott the Woz on Nintendo Online and you aren't.\n\n\nPATREON (early videos, no ads, credits\u2026) = http://www.patreon.com/caddicarus \nTWITCH = http://www.twitch.tv/Caddicarus\nINSTAGRAM = http://www.instagram.com/caddicarus\nTIKTOK = https://www.tiktok.com/@caddicarus\nLETTERBOXD MOVIE REVIEWS = http://www.letterboxd.com/Caddicarus\nTWITTER = http://www.twitter.com/Caddicarus\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews and Nintendo games like my Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour review for the Nintendo Switch 2 on my channel...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#nintendo #nintendoswitch2 #nintendoswitch #caddicarus #switch2"
