What\u2019s left to give?\nWhen everything\u2019s broken\nChasing the wind\nUnder those scars, there\u2019s a lion within\nStay in the moment\nAnd history lasts because you wrote it\n\nMake your whole life worth the Sacrifice\nEvery scream you cry worth the blood you\u2019ve given\nTo bathe in the floodlights, would you Sacrifice it all?\n(Oh, it all)\n\u2018Til they know your name\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n\nFabled the ground below your feet\nThe heroes you worship\nAnd legends you read\nThere\u2019s only one step below eternity\nAnd history lasts because you walked it\n\nMake your whole life worth the Sacrifice\nEvery scream they cry worth the blood you\u2019ve given\nTo bathe in the floodlights, would you Sacrifice it all?\n(Oh, it all)\n\u2018Til they know your name\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh, it all)\n\u2018Til they know your name\n\nTags:\n#leagueoflegends #sacrifice #lyrics"
