behisaab kyu\nAasu behisaab\nKhair hai yaaron kam se kam\nJaan se jaa na paaye hum\nKhair hai yaaron kam se kam\nJaan se jaa na paaye hum\nInkaar ke bahaane kayi baar karte karte\n\nHumne wahin lagaya dil\nJahaan dil lagana mana tha\nAkhir wahin kiye sajde jahan\nSar jhukana mana tha\nKyu zindagi bita di jahaan pe\nik pal bitaana mana tha\nKyu us gali mein rehte they hum\nJahaan roz jaana mana tha\n\nZamaane ki taraah\nHum bhi tode hain gaye\nAise tanha to na the Tanha chode hain gaye\nJo duaayein dete they\nHaan usi ke hothon se\nAise waise lafz bhi\nHumse bole hain gaye\n\nbaitho kisi roz tanhai mein\nRakho samne wakt ke aaine\nJo aagea chehra nazar vo kahin\nTumhe bewafa kehke has na pade\n\nTujhe dil diya istemaal huye\nHai tujhmein bhi dil ye khayaal rahe\nTujhe dil diya istemaal huye\nHai tujhmein bhi dil ye khayaal rahe\n\nHumne jalaaya dil jahaan diye bhi jalaana mana tha\nKar baithe yaad vo chehra jisko bhulaana mana tha\nHum aazmaye gaye magar unhe aazmana mana tha\nHumne wahin lagaya dil jahan dil lagana mana tha\n\nZamaane ki taraah\nHum bhi tode hain gaye\nAise tanha to na the Tanha chode hain gaye\nJo duaayein dete they\nHaan usi ke hothon se\nAise waise lafz bhi\nHumse bole hain gaye\n\n\u266a\ud835\udc6d\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc8d \ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88
