Get tickets now.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, Blumhouse\u2019s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town\u2019s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike\u2019s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy\u2019s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy\u2019s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

                "description": "This was recorded Sept 13, 2025. The most awaited 8G Podcast episode, because it is with the undisputed GOAT of MLBB, Karltzy. 5 MPL PH titles, 1 MSC Title, 1 SEA Games Gold Medal, 2 World Championships, and a lot more in between. Karl literally 100% completed MLBB, and is showing no signs of stopping. \n\nThis interview started a little bit slow because we had to talk about his M2 journey, but I promise you, when we hit the pedal, we were non-stop. Karltzy is easily the best character there is in PH MLBB, and this podcast is one for the books. Enjoy.\n\nP.S. I was very sick during this day, and it just so happened that this day for MPL went overtime because of the matches. Our interview eventually started 11pm, so please bear with our energy level, how ragged I look, and how bad the camera angles were (the place was so small because it had to be done in the same venue as MPL regular season, and I set it up all on my own).\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n4:04 Falcons' Struggles\n10:05 End of Sponsored Segment\n12:15 Karltzy's transfer to Bren Esports\n22:22 Season 6 Balagbagan\n38:20 Season 7, Karl's trashtalking\n46:08 \"The Downfall\"\n49:56 Yawi's offer\n55:45 Karl's \"EGO\"\n59:30 Changes that needed to be done\n1:33:13 Season 11 ECHO and Karl's Mouth\n1:38:39 Wolf's \"IMAGINATION THEORY\" and Karl's confirmation\n1:44:24 MSC 2023\n1:48:47 Season 12.\n1:56:39 Karl didn't expect their S13 Championship\n2:01:44 Season 14's disappointments.\n2:06:10 Utility vs Assassin Junglers\n2:17:52 Karl's RIVALS\n2:28:45 Karl's Dream Team\n2:32:22 What makes a great player?",

                    "description": "This was recorded Sept 13, 2025. The most awaited 8G Podcast episode, because it is with the undisputed GOAT of MLBB, Karltzy. 5 MPL PH titles, 1 MSC Title, 1 SEA Games Gold Medal, 2 World Championships, and a lot more in between. Karl literally 100% completed MLBB, and is showing no signs of stopping. \n\nThis interview started a little bit slow because we had to talk about his M2 journey, but I promise you, when we hit the pedal, we were non-stop. Karltzy is easily the best character there is in PH MLBB, and this podcast is one for the books. Enjoy.\n\nP.S. I was very sick during this day, and it just so happened that this day for MPL went overtime because of the matches. Our interview eventually started 11pm, so please bear with our energy level, how ragged I look, and how bad the camera angles were (the place was so small because it had to be done in the same venue as MPL regular season, and I set it up all on my own).\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n4:04 Falcons' Struggles\n10:05 End of Sponsored Segment\n12:15 Karltzy's transfer to Bren Esports\n22:22 Season 6 Balagbagan\n38:20 Season 7, Karl's trashtalking\n46:08 \"The Downfall\"\n49:56 Yawi's offer\n55:45 Karl's \"EGO\"\n59:30 Changes that needed to be done\n1:33:13 Season 11 ECHO and Karl's Mouth\n1:38:39 Wolf's \"IMAGINATION THEORY\" and Karl's confirmation\n1:44:24 MSC 2023\n1:48:47 Season 12.\n1:56:39 Karl didn't expect their S13 Championship\n2:01:44 Season 14's disappointments.\n2:06:10 Utility vs Assassin Junglers\n2:17:52 Karl's RIVALS\n2:28:45 Karl's Dream Team\n2:32:22 What makes a great player?"

There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d).
