ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Recorded on a 4-track recorder in Springsteen\u2019s New Jersey bedroom, the album marked a pivotal time in his life and is considered one of his most enduring works\u2014a raw, haunted acoustic record populated by lost souls searching for a reason to believe. \n \n\u201c\u2018Nebraska\u2019 is where Bruce chose truth over expectation\u2014a choice that still reverberates through everything he\u2019s written since. At that crossroads, he could have chased the bright lights and the roar of arenas, but instead he turned inward, armed only with silence, a four-track recorder, and the courage to confront himself. For him to trust me with telling that story\u2014the most vulnerable chapter of his life\u2014is the greatest honor I\u2019ve ever had as a filmmaker,\u201d says Cooper.\n \n\u201cThis film takes a couple years out of my life and looks at them very closely, a time when I made \u2018Nebraska\u2019 and went through some personal difficulties,\u201d says Springsteen. \u201cI\u2019m so appreciative of Jeremy Allen White and the entire cast for their wonderful and moving performances\u2014and Scott Cooper, one of the most generous collaborators I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d\n \nStarring Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen, the film is directed by Scott Cooper from his adaptation of Warren Zanes\u2019 book of the same name. \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere\u201d also features Jeremy Strong as Springsteen\u2019s long-time confidant and manager, Jon Landau; Paul Walter Hauser as guitar tech Mike Batlan; Odessa Young as Faye; Stephen Graham as Springsteen\u2019s father, Doug; Gaby Hoffman as Springsteen\u2019s mother, Adele; and David Krumholtz as Columbia executive, Al Teller. \n \nThe film is produced by Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson and Scott Stuber. Tracey Landon, Jon F. Vein and Zanes executive produce. The film includes an original score by composer Jeremiah Fraites, cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi, production design by Stefania Cella, costume design by Kasia Walicka-Maimone, and is edited by Pamela Martin.",
