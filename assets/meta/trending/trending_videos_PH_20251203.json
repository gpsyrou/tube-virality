Also, a lot of the game mechanics/glitches/redstone discussed in Unstable SMP videos are unique to the Unstable SMP / Unstable Universe and either will not work the same/do not exist in vanilla Minecraft. \n\nmusic also from: official minecraft soundtrack, official elder scrolls soundtracks, official enderal soundtrack, epidemic sound (https://www.epidemicsound.com), storyblocks (https://www.storyblocks.com), artlist (https://artlist.io), soundstripe (https://www.soundstripe.com), fesliyan studios (https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music), and envato (https://elements.envato.com/)\n\nEnderal Soundtrack (HQ): Bone Hunter - Knochenj\u00e4ger https://youtu.be/LchGhXSXxZk by Marvin Kopp, licensed under CC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nEnderal Soundtrack - Extended (HQ): Run of Things - Lauf der Dinge https://youtu.be/V5mExzEKWs8 by Marvin Kopp, licensed under CC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nwe wa we wa"
