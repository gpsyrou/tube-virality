The only way to beat him, is to bring Wemmbu back to spawn and prove that he's been lying this whole time. This is 2 Minecraft Pros VS 1000 Hunters. \n\nUnstable SMP:\n\u279c \u202a  @wemmbumc \n\u279c \u202a  @FlameFragsMC \n\u279c \u202a  @Spokeishere \n\u279c \u202a  @ParrotX2 \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable SMP series, where he is escaping Paragon / Proton: Minecraft's Most Secure Prison, or got hunted by a Minecraft Player who doesn't exist. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @wemmbumc @LettuceK @TheobaldTheBird @CoinMonkeExtras @PurpledMC @Boosfer \n\nOriginal music by  @tsynphonia \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!
