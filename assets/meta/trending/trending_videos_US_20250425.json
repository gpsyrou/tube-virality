Beneath the glow of fluorescent office lights and backed against trinket-stuffed shelves, the match feels divinely ordained.\n\nNormally, jazzy vocal trills and norte\u00f1o cumbia rhythms are star-crossed lovers, but not at the Tiny Desk. At the center of a pop-infused reinvigoration of traditional Mexican sounds, the members of Grupo Frontera are masters of unlikely pairings. Mega-producer and songwriter Edgar Barrera discovered Grupo Frontera at a quinceanera in his hometown, enthralled by the band's authenticity. He encouraged the band's Texas-bred beats, killer melodies and contemporary lyrics.\n\nThere's no better space to highlight the impressive musicality of the group and stunning vocals of Payo Solis than in a stripped down setting. \"Yo nac\u00ed pa' querer a la que no me quiere (I was born to love the one who doesn't love me),\" Payo coos.

I've quietly been working on my mental health, trying to find peace in the chaos. I know sharing this might open me up to judgment, but hiding it would mean losing the most important thing: my truth. I'm not perfect, but l'm healing-and I hope that means something to someone out there who's struggling too."
