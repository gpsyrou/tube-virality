The pair address denying their feelings for one another after a steamy kiss in Soul Ties, explaining it was a defense mechanism to protect the people they were then-interested in, Cierra Ortega and Taylor Williams. They share where they stand with the ex-Islanders now and whether they're ready to label each other boyfriend and girlfriend ahead of the soon-to-tape reunion, set to premiere on Aug. 25 on Peacock."

                "description": "Fat Joe and Jadakiss are joined by Pusha T and Malice, a.k.a. Clipse, to dive into their rap careers and their new album \u2018Let God Sort Em Out.\u2019 They discuss how they originally linked up with super producer Pharrell Williams and how he has been a huge part of their sound from the very beginning. Next, Pusha and Malice break down why they left Def Jam over the Kendrick Lamar track on their new album, explaining that in no way is it a beef record, but that politics and optics were the real reason Def Jam had a problem with it.

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects.
