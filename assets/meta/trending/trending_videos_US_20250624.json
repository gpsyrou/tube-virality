                "description": "Iran has warned Donald Trump that there will be a response to the US bombing of three key nuclear enrichment facilities.  \n\nIran's foreign minister warned of \"everlasting consequences\" to the \"outrageous\" strikes.   Its elite military force, the Revolutionary Guard, warned that US bases and forces in the region were \u201cvulnerable\u201d.     Iran\u2019s Parliament backed the closure of the Strait of Hormuz - a key transit route for global oil supplies. S\n\nIran\u2019s immediate response was to fire a new barrage of missiles at Israel, which began the war when it attacked Iran\u2019s nuclear sites ten days ago.   Iranian missiles hit residential buildings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, injuring around 80 people. \n\nPresident Donald Trump claimed the US strikes had \u201ctotally obliterated\" Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and told Tehran to \"make peace\" or face \"far greater\" attacks in future. \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Gordon Corera, Faisal Islam, Chris Mason, Siavash Ardalan, Orla Guerin, Lucy Williamson and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

It says it attacked dozens of targets including military centres and airbases. \u00a0 Smoke has been seen rising over the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv and there have been explosions in Jerusalem. \u00a0\n\nThe  bombardment is in retaliation for Israel's strikes on Iran, hitting military and nuclear sites.   It says it hit a nuclear facility in Isfahan following earlier strikes on the country's biggest nuclear facility at Natanz .Israel said the attacks were vital to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. \u00a0\n\nIran\u2019s spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, promised his country would 'inflict heavy blows' in response.\n\u00a0\nThere are warnings the conflict could escalate into all-out war.  \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson, Ione Wells, Frank Gardner, Tom Bateman, Gary O\u2019Donoghue and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

It says it attacked dozens of targets including military centres and airbases. \u00a0 Smoke has been seen rising over the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv and there have been explosions in Jerusalem. \u00a0\n\nThe  bombardment is in retaliation for Israel's strikes on Iran, hitting military and nuclear sites.   It says it hit a nuclear facility in Isfahan following earlier strikes on the country's biggest nuclear facility at Natanz .Israel said the attacks were vital to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. \u00a0\n\nIran\u2019s spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, promised his country would 'inflict heavy blows' in response.\n\u00a0\nThere are warnings the conflict could escalate into all-out war.  \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson, Ione Wells, Frank Gardner, Tom Bateman, Gary O\u2019Donoghue and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"
