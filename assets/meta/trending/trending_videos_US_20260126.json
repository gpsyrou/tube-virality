Will we AT LAST move on to 6 hunters?\n\nFollow my socials:\n\u27bd Twitter - @dream\n\u27bd Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n\u27bd Snapchat - @dream\n\nBadBoyHalo: @thesaintsofgames \nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap: @Sapnap \nAntfrost: @Antfrost \nawesamdude: @awesamdude \n\nSeed: 935327412\nVersion: 1.21.11\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is FIVE hunters. The 6th rendition of the 5 hunters series, the revival...\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.11 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friends George and Sapnap and BadBoyHalo and Antfrost  and Awesamdude try to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\n(Most) Music is from: @dreamproductionsXD \n\n#MinecraftManhunt"
