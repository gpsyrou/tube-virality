On the eve of professional football\u2019s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma. \n \nJust when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah\u2019s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam\u2019s training accelerates, Isaiah\u2019s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.  \n \nThe film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts. \n \nHIM is directed by Justin Tipping (Kicks) from an acclaimed Black List screenplay by Zack Akers & Skip Bronkie (creators of the sci-fi crime series Limetown) and by Justin Tipping.

It\u2019s been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway.

Your five volatile elements are Fatiha El-Ghorri, Jason Mantzoukas, Mathew Baynton, Rosie Ramsey and Stevie Martin - plus, of course, a compound of Daviesium and Horneium.\n\nThursday 1st May at 9pm on Channel 4 and 2nd May around the world on YouTube. \ud83e\uddea\n\n------------\n\nWatch full episodes in the UK on http://Channel4.com\nBuy Taskmaster merch: https://taskmasterstore.com/\n\n------------\n\nIn this Broadcast Award-winning, BAFTA and Emmy Award-nominated entertainment show, Taskmaster tyrant Greg Davies (Man Down, Cuckoo), with the help of his loyal assistant Alex Horne (The Horne Section and the show\u2019s creator), sets out to test the wiles, wit and wisdom of five hyper-competitive comedians.\n\nComedians that have risked life, limb, and dignity in the hope of making the Taskmaster proud so far include: Frank Skinner (The Frank Skinner Show), Mel Giedroyc (The Great British Bake Off), Romesh Ranganathan (Asian Provocateur), Hugh Dennis (Outnumbered), Sally Phillips (Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary), Rose Matafeo (Edinburgh Comedy Award Winner 2018), and Russell Howard (The Russell Howard Hour). Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness\u2019 golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion.\n\n#Taskmaster #Comedy\u00a0#GregDavies #AlexHorne"
