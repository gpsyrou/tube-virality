Get tickets now.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, Blumhouse\u2019s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town\u2019s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike\u2019s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy\u2019s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy\u2019s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

Brendan Fraser & Rachel Weisz Return for a legacy sequel to The Mummy Returns (The Mummy 2). They are ignoring the events of The Mummy 3 Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Explaining why Rachel Weisz left the franchise earlier, and why they're pretending like The Mummy 3 never happened. What this means for the plot of The Mummy 4. Other returning original legacy characters.\n\nThis is meant to be similar to Marvel bringing back Hugh Jackman as Wolverine during  Deadpool and Wolverine, Avengers Doomsday & Avengers Secret Wars. And explaining Universal's brief attempt to turn The Mummy Movies into a Marvel franchise with The Dark Universe Teaser with the Tom Cruise Mummy Movie 2017. And why that failed. \n\nI'll do more videos for The Mummy 4 once they release a trailer or footage. We'll get more news and announcements next year.\n\nThere's lots of big stuff coming before the end of the year, Marvel Avengers Doomsday Trailer, Spider-Man Brand New Day Trailer, Lanterns Trailer for Green Lantern, Superman 2 Man of Tomorrow, Supergirl Trailer, and lots more!\n\nMy full IT Welcome to Derry Episode 3 video will post sunday too!\n\nArt via https://www.deviantart.com/mrandrew7w7\n\nTwitch Channel https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\nTwitter  https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook  https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram  https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr  https://robotchallenger.com\nMy Website https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Video Playlists For Shows ::\n\nNew Emergency Awesome Videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nHouse of The Dragon Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nLoki Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\nThe Mandalorian Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\nGame of Thrones Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\nMarvel Movies and Avengers https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwWT3yd94Xc6n-ooI85uV_u\nAvatar The Last Airbender Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczx-z2jyyX4naSnE1A8d0hkC\nThe Boys Season 5 Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczw-KMQyuCrxcxV3mSQWTAdR\nSpider Man Videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzbRhRiGhj3-MaZ_24kadOy\nThe Batman and DC Movies https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nJustice League Snyder Cut Videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nStar Wars Movies https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczztMg8cT1WS0P8ATv-MhUEJ\n\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING!!",

Brendan Fraser & Rachel Weisz Return for a legacy sequel to The Mummy Returns (The Mummy 2). They are ignoring the events of The Mummy 3 Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Explaining why Rachel Weisz left the franchise earlier, and why they're pretending like The Mummy 3 never happened. What this means for the plot of The Mummy 4. Other returning original legacy characters.\n\nThis is meant to be similar to Marvel bringing back Hugh Jackman as Wolverine during  Deadpool and Wolverine, Avengers Doomsday & Avengers Secret Wars. And explaining Universal's brief attempt to turn The Mummy Movies into a Marvel franchise with The Dark Universe Teaser with the Tom Cruise Mummy Movie 2017. And why that failed. \n\nI'll do more videos for The Mummy 4 once they release a trailer or footage. We'll get more news and announcements next year.\n\nThere's lots of big stuff coming before the end of the year, Marvel Avengers Doomsday Trailer, Spider-Man Brand New Day Trailer, Lanterns Trailer for Green Lantern, Superman 2 Man of Tomorrow, Supergirl Trailer, and lots more!\n\nMy full IT Welcome to Derry Episode 3 video will post sunday too!\n\nArt via https://www.deviantart.com/mrandrew7w7\n\nTwitch Channel https://twitch.tv/emergencyawesome\nTwitter  https://x.com/awesomemergency\nFacebook  https://facebook.com/emergencyawesome\nInstagram  https://instagram.com/emergencyawesome\nTumblr  https://robotchallenger.com\nMy Website https://emergencyawesome.com\n\n:: Video Playlists For Shows ::\n\nNew Emergency Awesome Videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxQXxyV_2D8kuEs_QsuQIyJ\nHouse of The Dragon Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczxqJeNeCsF_ghizcTS9nM4X\nLoki Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczy8mUNqHU-35xtTd-JpJU3l\nThe Mandalorian Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzsN78nOjS-ABHwKaB7KONW\nGame of Thrones Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPOIeYdZ3QczxGuSDE8NtOuthqbKFChC0q\nMarvel Movies and Avengers https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwWT3yd94Xc6n-ooI85uV_u\nAvatar The Last Airbender Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczx-z2jyyX4naSnE1A8d0hkC\nThe Boys Season 5 Episodes https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3Qczw-KMQyuCrxcxV3mSQWTAdR\nSpider Man Videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczzbRhRiGhj3-MaZ_24kadOy\nThe Batman and DC Movies https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nJustice League Snyder Cut Videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczwCLH9RIm-7ui56ameRYmdQ\nStar Wars Movies https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOIeYdZ3QczztMg8cT1WS0P8ATv-MhUEJ\n\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING!!"

(I don't understand why)\nAs painful as this thing has been\nI just can't be with no one else\nSee I know what we've got to do (yeah)\nYou let go (you let go), and I'll let go too (and I'll let go)\n'Cause no one's hurt me more than you\nAnd no one ever will\nNo matter how I think we grow\nYou always seem to let me know\nIt ain't working (it ain't working), it ain't working (it ain't working)\nAnd when I try to walk away\nYou'd hurt yourself to make me stay\nThis is crazy (this is crazy), this is crazy (this is crazy)\nCare for me, care for me\nI know you care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Give) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\n(Care) Care for me, care for me\nYou said you'd care for me\n(There) There for me, there for me\nSaid you'd be there for me\n(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me\nYou said you'd die for me\n(Give) Give to me, give to me\nWhy won't you live for me?\nTake it down now\n(Cry) Take it down now\n(Give) Take it down now\n(Care) Take it down now\n(There) Take it down now\n(Cry) Take it down, take it down for now\n(Give)\n\n_____________\n\ud83c\udf05  Wallpaper: https://pixabay.com/\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u22c6\u22c5\u2606\u22c5\u22c6 \u2500\u2500\n\ud83c\udf05  Kami Records\n\u2728.Website: http://kamirecords.co/\n\u2728.
