I try to beat the game, while my friends George and Sapnap and BadBoyHalo and Antfrost try to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs.

I try to beat the game, while my friends George and Sapnap and BadBoyHalo and Antfrost try to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs.

Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects.

There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d).
