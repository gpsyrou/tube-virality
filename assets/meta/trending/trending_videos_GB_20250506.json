Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It\u2019s the only channel where you\u2019ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Follow the trail of destruction and uncover the mysteries of the continent to learn not just how to confront the dragons, but how to overcome them. Prepare potions, craft gear and level yourself up to do battle with the most powerful force on the continent. Make history, or become history. The smart money's on the dragon. But we do love an underdog!\n\n\nChop Trees! Shield yourself with runic energy! Turn bones into... peaches?\n\nJourney through the vast, vibrant regions of Ashenfall and unveil the ruins of forgotten civilisations to discover why wild, transformative magic spills from its fractured lands. Explode ore veins with a snap of your fingers. Conjure a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in an instant. The Anima-rich landscape of Ashenfall offers you a power unlike any other.\n\n\nEmbark on quests, level skills and wield runes to shape the world around you.\n\nExplore a stunning, hand-crafted landscape ravaged by Anima. This all-new adventure blends High Fantasy, light RPG elements, and iconic RuneScape lore into a never-before-seen continent. Venture into a land hidden since time immemorial, uncover ancient secrets, and battle legendary RuneScape creatures alongside entirely new foes like the fearsome Garou. Prepare to face a world filled with mystery, danger, and unforgettable encounters.\n\n\nAs with all RuneScape games, community is at the heart of everything we do.\n\nRuneScape: Dragonwilds is being shaped by player feedback every step of the way, from alpha through to 1.0 and beyond! The expansive continent of Ashenfall remains uncharted, and what lies beyond the veil is still a mystery\u2026 for now. Together, we\u2019ll uncover its secrets. Our community will continue to help build and guide our roadmap, a living document that will change and adapt to make this adventure the best it can be. We can't wait!\n\n\nRuneScape: Dragonwilds started Alpha testing in late 2024, and is launching into Early Access in Spring 2025. From here, our humble team of heroes is developing the project with player feedback at the very core.\n\nThis Steam Early Access game is currently not a finished game and may or may not change significantly over the course of development.
