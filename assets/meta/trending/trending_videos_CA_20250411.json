Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits\u2014Garrett \"The Garbage Man\" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)\u2014find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative\u2026the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.  \n\nConnect with A Minecraft Movie:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/AMinecraftMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@AMinecraftMovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AMinecraftMovie\nX: https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie\n\nConnect with WaterTower Music:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/watertowermusic\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@watertowermusic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WaterTowerMusic\nX: https://x.com/watertowermusic\nOfficial site: https://www.watertower-music.com/\n\nAbout WaterTower Music:\nWaterTower Music, the in-house label for the WarnerMedia companies, releases recorded music as rich and diverse as the companies themselves.
