For 2026, we\u2019re going bigger: more matches, a new roadshow finals experience for Stage 2, and hosting the first international event of the year with Masters Santiago. As we look ahead to the new season, we say goodbye to some legends but welcome ENVY who will be joining us to show his dominance across Challengers.\nThe road to Champions Shanghai is long, and it all starts with VCT Americas Kickoff, where we\u2019ll get our first look at 12 of the best teams in the world. Step one: conquer Kickoff and grab one of the three tickets to represent the region at Masters Santiago. So\u2026 who you got?\n\nWe\u2019re proud to work with our fantastic partners throughout 2026: Aim Lab, Pulsar, Red Bull, Samsung, Secretlab, and Verizon.\nFollow the below channels to get the latest information on VCT Americas:\nTwitter/X: https://www.x.com/valesportsna\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@valesportsna\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/valesportsna\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/valorant_americas\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@valorant_americas\nPhotos from the Event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/vctamericas/\nOfficial VALORANT Esports News: https://www.valorantesports.com/news\nWeb: https://www.valorantesports.com\n\n#VCTAmericas #VCT",

For 2026, we\u2019re going bigger: more matches, a new roadshow finals experience for Stage 2, and hosting the first international event of the year with Masters Santiago. As we look ahead to the new season, we say goodbye to some legends but welcome ENVY who will be joining us to show his dominance across Challengers.\nThe road to Champions Shanghai is long, and it all starts with VCT Americas Kickoff, where we\u2019ll get our first look at 12 of the best teams in the world. Step one: conquer Kickoff and grab one of the three tickets to represent the region at Masters Santiago. So\u2026 who you got?\n\nWe\u2019re proud to work with our fantastic partners throughout 2026: Aim Lab, Pulsar, Red Bull, Samsung, Secretlab, and Verizon.\nFollow the below channels to get the latest information on VCT Americas:\nTwitter/X: https://www.x.com/valesportsna\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@valesportsna\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/valesportsna\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/valorant_americas\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@valorant_americas\nPhotos from the Event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/vctamericas/\nOfficial VALORANT Esports News: https://www.valorantesports.com/news\nWeb: https://www.valorantesports.com\n\n#VCTAmericas #VCT"
