Captain Paul Dawson headed his side in front just before half-time before Isaac Buckley-Ricketts doubled the Silkmen's lead in the second-half. The hosts were able to hold off a late surge from the reinging champions at the Moss Rose, producing what could be the greatest cup upset of all time.\n\n#Football #EmiratesFACup #Highlights #FACup #Macclesfield #CrystalPalace\n\nSubscribe:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/thefacup\n\nFollow @EmiratesFACup on X for in-game highlights and match updates!\nhttps://x.com/emiratesfacup\n\nTo find out more about The Emirates FA Cup, visit:\nTheFA.com/EmiratesFACup\n\nThe Emirates FA Cup on Facebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/TheFACup\n\nThe Emirates FA Cup on TikTok\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@emiratesfacup"

Directed by the Russo Brothers\u2014Anthony and Joe Russo\u2014the film reunites many beloved heroes and introduces new alliances. As the MCU expands its multiverse saga, this crossover brings together iconic teams such as the Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Wakandans, and the New Avengers to confront the formidable villain Doctor Doom, portrayed in a stunning twist by Robert Downey Jr.\n\nThe ensemble cast features returning favorites such as Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Letitia Wright (Shuri), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Florence Pugh (Yelena), and many more. Among its most notable reunions are X-Men legends Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler), Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) and James Marsden (Cyclops). The Fantastic Four join the fray with Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm and Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards. The film's story picks up 14 months after Thunderbolts (2025), as multiple superhero teams unite against Doctor Doom's machinations in an epic multiverse showdown.\n\nAlan Silvestri, acclaimed composer of previous MCU hits, returns to score Avengers: Doomsday, promising a powerful musical backbone. The screenplay is crafted by Michael Waldron and Stephen McFeely, combining fresh narrative perspectives with seasoned MCU storytelling. Filming commenced in April 2025 at Pinewood Studios in England and will span approximately six months, underscoring Marvel's ambitious scale and logistical coordination. With a release date firmly set for December 18, 2026, and a sequel (Avengers: Secret Wars) slated for December 17, 2027, Doomsday is positioned as a pivotal chapter in the concluding arc of the MCU\u2019s Multiverse Saga.\n\nEditing, VFX, SFX, Thumbnail by @GalacticTrailerOfficial \nPlease subscribe:\n\u2705YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/GalacticTrailerOfficial\n\u2705Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/darthvideos/\n\u2705Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@darthtrailer\n\u2705 Twitter: https://twitter.com/Darth_Trailer\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSoftware I use: Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Photoshop, Adobe Audition, Unreal Engine 5.4\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25c1 On our channel, we create trailer mashups \u25b7 Trailer mashups, also known as recut trailers, are crafted by gathering various film footage from one or more movies and re-editing them to form a brand-new trailer.

See the movie only in theaters and IMAX February 13.\n\nSet against the sun-bleached grit of Los Angeles, Crime 101 weaves the tale of an elusive jewel thief (Chris Hemsworth) whose string of heists along the 101 freeway have mystified police. When he eyes the score of a lifetime, his path crosses that of a disillusioned insurance broker (Halle Berry) who is facing her own crossroads. Convinced he has found a pattern, a relentless detective (Mark Ruffalo) is closing in, raising the stakes even higher. As the heist approaches, the line between hunter and hunted begins to blur, and all three are faced with life-defining choices\u2013and the realization that there can be no turning back. \n\nAdapted from Don Winslow\u2019s acclaimed novella of the same name, the film is written and directed by Bart Layton (American Animals, The Imposter).

                "description": "Jass Bajwa presents the official music video of Rishtey. It is a touching Punjabi song that shows the deep bond between a daughter and her family. As she gets ready to leave her parents\u2019 home after marriage, memories of childhood, siblings, and family moments come rushing back.\n\nThe song captures her love, fear, and pain of leaving the house where she grew up. She remembers small fights, shared laughter, and the comfort of seeing her parents every day. Before starting her new life, she makes emotional requests to her brother and sister, showing how strongly she is connected to her family. Rishtey beautifully reflects love, memories, and the strength it takes to move forward while keeping family close to the heart.\n\nListen to Rishtey on all audio platforms:\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/5Ci1DYARpj8cgYcHFDikgS\n\nApple Music: https://music.apple.com/in/album/rishtey-single/1866753482\n\nJioSaavn: https://www.jiosaavn.com/album/rishtey/Sb8KAYZ6jhI_\n\nGaana: https://gaana.com/album/rishtey-punjabi-2026\n\nAmazon Music: https://music.amazon.in/albums/B0GF2XNKLN\n\nYouTube Music: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AWBV0RXgK5c\n\nCredits:-\nSinger- Jass Bajwa \nLyrics- Narinder Batth \nMusic- Desi Crew \nMix- Dense\nVideo- Stalinveer Singh \nFemale Model- Baljinder Kaur Bains\nEdit & DI- Gurjaan\nDOP- Deep VFX\nMake Up Artist- RavneetK\nMix by Dense\nMAKEUPARTIST_RAVNEETk\n\nSubscribe to the Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JassBajwaOfficial\n\nFollow Jass Bajwa:-\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialjassbajwa/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JassBajwaOfficial\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ziCsS6bX7D9e5cuCVRktx\n\nTeam Believe Artist Services - https://linktr.ee/believeartistservicesindia\n\u25ba Digital Partner :- Believe Artist Services \n\u25ba For Licensing inquiries:\nEmail:- sync-india@believedigital.com\n\n#jassbajwa #rishtey #punjabisong",

                    "description": "Jass Bajwa presents the official music video of Rishtey. It is a touching Punjabi song that shows the deep bond between a daughter and her family. As she gets ready to leave her parents\u2019 home after marriage, memories of childhood, siblings, and family moments come rushing back.\n\nThe song captures her love, fear, and pain of leaving the house where she grew up. She remembers small fights, shared laughter, and the comfort of seeing her parents every day. Before starting her new life, she makes emotional requests to her brother and sister, showing how strongly she is connected to her family. Rishtey beautifully reflects love, memories, and the strength it takes to move forward while keeping family close to the heart.\n\nListen to Rishtey on all audio platforms:\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/5Ci1DYARpj8cgYcHFDikgS\n\nApple Music: https://music.apple.com/in/album/rishtey-single/1866753482\n\nJioSaavn: https://www.jiosaavn.com/album/rishtey/Sb8KAYZ6jhI_\n\nGaana: https://gaana.com/album/rishtey-punjabi-2026\n\nAmazon Music: https://music.amazon.in/albums/B0GF2XNKLN\n\nYouTube Music: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AWBV0RXgK5c\n\nCredits:-\nSinger- Jass Bajwa \nLyrics- Narinder Batth \nMusic- Desi Crew \nMix- Dense\nVideo- Stalinveer Singh \nFemale Model- Baljinder Kaur Bains\nEdit & DI- Gurjaan\nDOP- Deep VFX\nMake Up Artist- RavneetK\nMix by Dense\nMAKEUPARTIST_RAVNEETk\n\nSubscribe to the Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/JassBajwaOfficial\n\nFollow Jass Bajwa:-\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/officialjassbajwa/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JassBajwaOfficial\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ziCsS6bX7D9e5cuCVRktx\n\nTeam Believe Artist Services - https://linktr.ee/believeartistservicesindia\n\u25ba Digital Partner :- Believe Artist Services \n\u25ba For Licensing inquiries:\nEmail:- sync-india@believedigital.com\n\n#jassbajwa #rishtey #punjabisong"
