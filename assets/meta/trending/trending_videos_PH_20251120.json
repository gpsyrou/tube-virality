(Love love)\nWe give it all we got (Give it all we got)\nYou finally left the table (Uh, uh)\nAnd what a simple thought\nYou're starving 'til you're not\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)\nHave messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)\nLife is a song, it ends when it ends\nYou move on\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's when I told you, \"It's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nSleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\"\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is just\nA storm inside a teacup\nBut shelter here with me, my love\nThunder like a drum\nThis life will beat you up, up, up, up\nThis is just\nA temporary speed bump\nBut failure brings you freedom\nAnd I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you sweat it, baby, it's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nOh, so sleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before (No)\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n.........\n\ud83d\udce7 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n\ud83d\udc8c Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com\n.........\n\ud83d\udcdd Licensing / Sync Requests for 7clouds Releases: licensing@7clouds.org\n.........\n\n#taylorswift #opalite #lyrics #7clouds",

(Love love)\nWe give it all we got (Give it all we got)\nYou finally left the table (Uh, uh)\nAnd what a simple thought\nYou're starving 'til you're not\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)\nHave messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)\nLife is a song, it ends when it ends\nYou move on\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's when I told you, \"It's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nSleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\"\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is just\nA storm inside a teacup\nBut shelter here with me, my love\nThunder like a drum\nThis life will beat you up, up, up, up\nThis is just\nA temporary speed bump\nBut failure brings you freedom\nAnd I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you sweat it, baby, it's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nOh, so sleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before (No)\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n.........\n\ud83d\udce7 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n\ud83d\udc8c Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com\n.........\n\ud83d\udcdd Licensing / Sync Requests for 7clouds Releases: licensing@7clouds.org\n.........\n\n#taylorswift #opalite #lyrics #7clouds"
