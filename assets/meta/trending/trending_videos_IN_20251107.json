                "description": "\ud83d\udd34 Live IND Vs AUS Match | Live Cricket Match Today | IND vs AUS 4th T20 Live 1st Innings Livescore\n\nFor Contact umerhafeez2022@gmail.com \n\nTopics to be covered in the live stream \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\n\nIndia vs Australia Live Match Today \nIndia vs Australia Live Cricket Score \nIND vs AUS Live Match Today \nCricket Live Score \nLive Cricket Match Today\n\nIt's Ashes squad selection day in Australia, and it's likely that most cricketing headlines will revolve around who's made the final cut for Perth. Unless you're here on the Gold Coas\n\nAfter a washout in Canberra, we've seen two pretty high-octane T20Is in Melbourne and Hobart. If Australia were the one who steamrolled India at the MCG courtesy an all-time great T20I spell from Josh Hazlewood, it was the Indian bowlers' turn to set up the win with the ball.\n\nWe reaches its end with everything still to play for on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane, come Saturday.\n\nWhen: Australia v India, 4th T20I, November 6, 2025, 18:15 hrs Local Time, 19:15 hrs AEDT, 13:45 hrs IST\n\nWhere: Gold Coast Stadium (Carrara), Gold Coast\n\nWhat to expect: There will be no talk of weather around this contest except for it being sunny and excellent on the Gold Coast. After 82,000 packed the MCG last week, there'll be a relatively fewer people in attendance here at Carrara, with the capacity at around 20,000 at this boutique venue. But the hype around this being the Indian men's first game here has been massive enough for us to get another full house. There's a bit of an unknown around how the surface will play here but the boundaries aren't the biggest, and there will be potentially a lot of balls flying in the direction of the crowds.\n\nTeam News\n\nAustralia\n\nWith Travis Head having decided to get some Sheffield Shield action in as part of his conditioning and preparation for the Ashes, there's an opening for Mitch Owen to go up top alongside captain Mitch Marsh. The return of Glenn Maxwell will be a major boost in terms of experience and also quality to the middle order, which looks pretty ominous with his addition. It'll be interesting to see if Mahli Beardman gets a nod in what will be an exciting first look at the young fast bowler at this level.\n\nProbable XI:Mitch Marsh (c), Mitch Owen, Josh Inglis (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Tim David, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Short, Nathan Ellis, Xavier Bartlett, Matthew Kuhnemann, Mahli Beardman/Ben Dwarshius\n\nIndia\n\nIndia rung in the changes after the MCG and it worked out well for them in Hobart with Washington Sundar playing a key role with the bat. Though the top order should remain the same as Shubman Gill continues to try and finish this tour on a high with the bat, the middle order should stay the same too with Jitesh Sharma having impressed with his cameo. ind vs aus t20 highlights. india vs australia t20 highlights.

Unless you're here on the Gold Coas\n\nAfter a washout in Canberra, we've seen two pretty high-octane T20Is in Melbourne and Hobart. If Australia were the one who steamrolled India at the MCG courtesy an all-time great T20I spell from Josh Hazlewood, it was the Indian bowlers' turn to set up the win with the ball.\n\nWe reaches its end with everything still to play for on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane, come Saturday.\n\nWhen: Australia v India, 4th T20I, November 6, 2025, 18:15 hrs Local Time, 19:15 hrs AEDT, 13:45 hrs IST\n\nWhere: Gold Coast Stadium (Carrara), Gold Coast\n\nWhat to expect: There will be no talk of weather around this contest except for it being sunny and excellent on the Gold Coast. After 82,000 packed the MCG last week, there'll be a relatively fewer people in attendance here at Carrara, with the capacity at around 20,000 at this boutique venue. But the hype around this being the Indian men's first game here has been massive enough for us to get another full house. There's a bit of an unknown around how the surface will play here but the boundaries aren't the biggest, and there will be potentially a lot of balls flying in the direction of the crowds.\n\nTeam News\n\nAustralia\n\nWith Travis Head having decided to get some Sheffield Shield action in as part of his conditioning and preparation for the Ashes, there's an opening for Mitch Owen to go up top alongside captain Mitch Marsh. The return of Glenn Maxwell will be a major boost in terms of experience and also quality to the middle order, which looks pretty ominous with his addition. It'll be interesting to see if Mahli Beardman gets a nod in what will be an exciting first look at the young fast bowler at this level.\n\nProbable XI:Mitch Marsh (c), Mitch Owen, Josh Inglis (wk), Glenn Maxwell, Tim David, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Short, Nathan Ellis, Xavier Bartlett, Matthew Kuhnemann, Mahli Beardman/Ben Dwarshius\n\nIndia\n\nIndia rung in the changes after the MCG and it worked out well for them in Hobart with Washington Sundar playing a key role with the bat. Though the top order should remain the same as Shubman Gill continues to try and finish this tour on a high with the bat, the middle order should stay the same too with Jitesh Sharma having impressed with his cameo. ind vs aus t20 highlights. india vs australia t20 highlights.
