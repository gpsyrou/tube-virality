Or will a liar get away with -- wait, actually... what's going on with this polygraph machine? It seems to be some sort of vessel for universal truths.  It holds the answers to every question.

We're releasing comedic sketches of all shapes and sizes. Sci-Fi, Heists, animation, movie tropes, fantasy, absurdist bits, and plenty of fun new experiments.
