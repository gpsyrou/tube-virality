                "description": "The Pacers defeated the Thunder, 111-110 tonight in Oklahoma City. Pascal Siakam led the way for the Pacers with 19 points on 7-15 from the field (1-2 from 3) to go along with 10 rebounds and 3 assists. For the Thunder, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a team-high 38 points on 14-30 from the field (3-6 from 3). The Pacers lead the series 1-0.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers mounted an incredible comeback in the 4th quarter, at one point down 15 points, they managed to rally back and in the end it was Tyrese Haliburton who once again put the team ahead late! This is the FIFTH time this postseason that the Pacers have rallied from a 15+ point deficit, which is the MOST by any team in the playoffs since 1998! They also have become just the third team in NBA Playoffs history to rally from a 15 point deficit in the 4th quarter, joining the 2011 Dallas Mavericks and the 1992 Chicago Bulls. Haliburton's shot to put the team ahead with 0.3 seconds remaining put Tyrese in the history books, as that marks the FIFTH time this playoff run where he has made a go-ahead, game-winning or game-tying shot within the last 30 seconds of the 4th quarter or in overtime, the most of ANY player in NBA Playoff history! The record was formerly held by Ray Allen in his 2009 run, with four made shots of that variety.\n\nNever miss a moment with the latest news, trending stories and highlights to bring you closer to your favorite players and teams.\nDownload now \u27a1 https://nba.smart.link/NBAApp-YTDes\n\nSubscribe to the NBA: https://on.nba.com/2JX5gSN",

Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award\u00ae nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz\u2019s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar\u00ae winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda\u2019s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba\u2019s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars\u00ae for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar\u00ae winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

                "description": "The political partnership between Donald Trump and Elon and Elon Musk has exploded  in spectacular fashion with a bitter war of words.\n\nIt began when Mr Trump said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d at Elon Musk\u2019s criticism of his flagship spending bill.   He said they had had a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will any more\u201d. \n\nElon Musk responded on his social media platform X with a series of increasingly heated remarks about his former boss.   He said the President\u2019s claims that he has supported the budget bill were \u201cfalse\u201d.   He said Mr Trump was  \u201cungrateful\u201d for his help in getting elected and would have lost the election without his financial support.   Mr Musk warned that the President\u2019s tariffs policy would lead to a recession.\n\nThen Musk made an explosive allegation, claiming without evidence that Donald Trump is named in the files about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  He said that \u201cis the real reason they have not been made public\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump suggested that the easiest way to save money would be to terminate the billions of dollars in government contracts and subsidies that go to Elon Musk\u2019s companies.   Musk said that President Trump should be impeached.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith and Simon Jack.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

                    "description": "The political partnership between Donald Trump and Elon and Elon Musk has exploded  in spectacular fashion with a bitter war of words.\n\nIt began when Mr Trump said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d at Elon Musk\u2019s criticism of his flagship spending bill.   He said they had had a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t know if we will any more\u201d. \n\nElon Musk responded on his social media platform X with a series of increasingly heated remarks about his former boss.   He said the President\u2019s claims that he has supported the budget bill were \u201cfalse\u201d.   He said Mr Trump was  \u201cungrateful\u201d for his help in getting elected and would have lost the election without his financial support.   Mr Musk warned that the President\u2019s tariffs policy would lead to a recession.\n\nThen Musk made an explosive allegation, claiming without evidence that Donald Trump is named in the files about the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  He said that \u201cis the real reason they have not been made public\u201d.\n\nDonald Trump suggested that the easiest way to save money would be to terminate the billions of dollars in government contracts and subsidies that go to Elon Musk\u2019s companies.   Musk said that President Trump should be impeached.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith and Simon Jack.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it.

It's why I finished the recording process in Goa surrounded by some of the best musicians in India. It was an incredible creative process. I shot the music video with Liam Pethick and Nic Minns across my India tour earlier this year, we wanted to showcase the beauty and breadth of the country and its culture. The final jigsaw piece for me was getting @Official_ArijitSingh on the record, but it was a journey to get there and such an amazing day of music and family. Me and him have done a full Punjabi version of the song that will come out in the next few weeks, which has a lot more of him on it. This is the album version of the song, and my favourite song on the album. Hope you guys love it.

One of the most successful games of all time has finally been adapted to the big screen, and it\u2019s led to quite a few mini-riots involving a chicken jockey. Go figure.\n\nA Minecraft Movie definitely raises some questions. Like who is the main character? Are those weird diamonds even worth anything? Why did the chicken jockey drive everyone insane?\n\nTo answer all of these questions and more, step inside Ryan George\u2019s Pitch Meeting for A Minecraft Movie!\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThunderbolts* Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCks7E4Qa6k\n\nPitch Meeting Episode 400\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNH2if9ymBE\n\n#pitchmeeting #ryangeorge #aminecraftmovie #minecraft #jackblack #jasonmomoa #chickenjockey #supereasybarelyaninconvenience #wowwowwowwow"

Up until now I had been using a rope and stick to spin the fan rotor of the blower. Though this was useable and produced continuous one way rotation, it was unable to reach higher revolutions per minute due to limitations of the drive mechanism. As a result, only low pressure air flow was attainable. This is enough to smelt iron ore to produce a bloom. But it is not solid, with the result being slag with high carbon steel or cast iron droplets instead of a large solid bloom of low carbon iron. A pulley and belt produces continuous rotation and can be geared up with different pulley sizes to produce greater rpm.\n\n I first made a large clay wheel to be cranked by hand and a small one to drive the fan. It worked but had issues due to weight wasn't durable. The small clay wheel worked ok though. The next test was of a cane wheel made by weaving a basket without a base so if formed a cylinder for the belt to wrap around. This worked better and was faster. It sometimes has issues with the frame it's set in though. The final test was with a \"floating\" version of the cane wheel meaning that it wasn't set in a frame but had 2 handles and was spun while holding with 2 hands. This worked with fewer issues but would not be scalable. \n\nAll of the wheels in the video where 25 cm in diameter and gave a ratio of about 1:10 (one hand turn = 10 fan turns). The previous rope stick blower gives about 960 rpm whereas the the pulley and belt might give 1200 if cranked twice per second, though this may be exceeding its limits of durability. A larger diameter wheel of say 50 cm will give 1:20 ratios. Future experiments will need to be done to see if they make a difference to smelting results.\n\n00:00-14:05 Making the parts\n14:05-17:34 Clay pulley wheel\n17:34-24:54 Cane pulley wheel \n24:54-27:48 \"Floating\" pulley wheel (not fixed to a frame)\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.
