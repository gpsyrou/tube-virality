ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Our camera operators were able to find her so we knew where she was and that she was safe.\n\nAfter spending the night where she landed yesterday, this morning Sunny spread her wings again.\n\nWhile Jackie and Shadow spent the night on their usual favorite roosting limbs in that tree, Sunny was on the branches above them\u2014and yes, they were aware she was there, as they looked up at her a few times. \n\nThis morning while we panned Cam2, the wide-angle camera, to check on them\u2026Sunny chose that moment to fly back to the nest tree\u2026\n\n\u2026the cams are set to move slowly so as not to disturb the eagles or any other wildlife, so we missed her flight\u2026but, watching from the nest, Gizmo tracked Sunny\u2019s trip. \n\nSunny apparently couldn\u2019t quite figure out the front or back door entrances to the nest itself and instead, landed on top of the nest tree canopy! \nShe stayed up above the nest, moving about to different areas for over an hour and a half. While Sunny bounced around up there, Gizmo stared up often, trying to figure out what Sunny was doing.\n\nThen Sunny flew off the nest tree canopy and over to the nearby Simba Tree\u2026she\u2019s been there for over an hour. She seems to be checking out all the nearby trees to get a handle on this traveling around wherever you want idea.\n\nAs she can now go anywhere, we will work to keep an eye/or a lens on her when we can as she continues her new explorations! And we will continue watching Gizmo as she keeps a curious eye on Sunny\u2019s movements and does her own development to decide when she's ready to fly.\n\nSandy\n\nFriends of Big Bear Valley (FOBBV) https://friendsofbigbearvalley.org/\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/fobbv.official/\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/FOBBV/\nPrivate Facebook Group https://www.facebook.com/groups/fobbv\nTikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@fobbv.official",

                "description": "At 10:46 am this morning, Sunny flew from the upper Y-branch right out into the world! \n\nShe put up her wings to catch the wind and then jumped up and let those beautiful wings carry her. She circled back around toward Shadow and Jackie\u2019s favorite roost tree\u2026\n\nGizmo watched the whole thing from right beside Sunny. She looked completely fascinated and kept her eyes on Sunny flying away from the nest.\n\u2026and a bit later, our awesome camera operatiors were able to find Sunny, perching near the top of the roost tree (upper center on the screen) \u2013 watch closely and her practice flapping will show you where she is. \n\nSunny may return to the nest\u2026Jackie and Shadow\u2019s previous eaglets have all done that. It is all up to her at this point. But in any case, Jackie and Shadow will be keeping an eye on Sunny, bringing her food, guarding her and teaching her all that she needs to know to be out in the world. All while they also continue taking care of Gizmo. Gizmo probably now has a lot to think about.\nCongratulations, Sunny! \u2013 as we get to feel exuberance of this beautiful success and at the same time, sadness for change that means seeing her less often.

                    "description": "At 10:46 am this morning, Sunny flew from the upper Y-branch right out into the world! \n\nShe put up her wings to catch the wind and then jumped up and let those beautiful wings carry her. She circled back around toward Shadow and Jackie\u2019s favorite roost tree\u2026\n\nGizmo watched the whole thing from right beside Sunny. She looked completely fascinated and kept her eyes on Sunny flying away from the nest.\n\u2026and a bit later, our awesome camera operatiors were able to find Sunny, perching near the top of the roost tree (upper center on the screen) \u2013 watch closely and her practice flapping will show you where she is. \n\nSunny may return to the nest\u2026Jackie and Shadow\u2019s previous eaglets have all done that. It is all up to her at this point. But in any case, Jackie and Shadow will be keeping an eye on Sunny, bringing her food, guarding her and teaching her all that she needs to know to be out in the world. All while they also continue taking care of Gizmo. Gizmo probably now has a lot to think about.\nCongratulations, Sunny! \u2013 as we get to feel exuberance of this beautiful success and at the same time, sadness for change that means seeing her less often.

Straightforward and plain has never been E-40's nature, and that left-of-center spit has been the thing that has sustained his illustrious entertainment career.\n\nAt the Desk, Charlie Hustle sets things off with \"Da Bumble\" from In a Major Way and continues to bounce through a catalog of big hits sprinkled with nods to his day ones. Producer Lil Jon brought him back to the mainstream in the early 2000s with \"Tell Me When to Go,\" \"U and Dat\" and \"Snap Yo Fingers,\" while TikTok injected new life in \"Choices (Yup)\" and introduced him to Gen Z. \"I'm on my fourth wind!\" 40 tells us. No lies told.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Da Bumble\"\n\"Yay Area\" \n\"Sprinkle Me\"\n\"Captain Save a Hoe\"\n\"Snap Yo Fingers\"\n\"U and Dat\" \n\"Choices (Yup)\"\n\"Hope I Don't Go Back\"\n\"1-Luv\" \n\"Function\"\n\"Tell Me When to Go\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nE-40: vocals\nKev Choice: music director, keys\nBosko Kante: music director, background vocals\nMartin Luther: guitar, background vocals\nHoward Wiley: saxophone, EWI\nMarcus Phillips: bass, keys\nDame Drummer: drums, background vocals\nSilk-E The People's Champ aka Sherri Stack-A-Grip: background vocals\nDJ KMP: DJ, background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor:  Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Mitra I.
