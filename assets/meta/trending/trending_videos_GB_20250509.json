I wanted everyone in that room to have felt the same feelings of nostalgia, longing, joy and sadness I had felt from going through my old phone. I asked all of them to submit a video, a photo or a message from their old phone that meant a lot to them to get into the gig that night, and we all shared in a night of music, dancing, laughing and tears. It was really magical, maybe my favourite music video I\u2019ve ever made. Shout out to Emil Nava for making my dream happen, all the amazing people who built the Old Phone pub for one night only in Ipswich MA, and of course, all the wonderful people of Ipswich MA who made us feel so welcome that day.

The 8th Mini Album, 'DUH!' introduces a HERO who refuses to be taken for granted, boldly asking, \u201cYou really don\u2019t need us?\u201d and going on strike in response. It flips the idea that heroes must always be noble, instead portraying a bold, free-spirited side of P1Harmony with a playful twist.\n\nThe title track 'DUH!', which shares its name with the album, embodies the album's core message. Built on a vintage beat with a retro-inspired groove, the song merges old-school charm with P1Harmony\u2019s trendsetting vocal style. The title track 'DUH!' is an expression conveying the attitude of \"Who\u2019s the big shot here? Of course, it\u2019s me! Isn\u2019t that obvious?\" and playfully showcases a more self-assured and bold version of the HERO. Unlike the traditional HERO, who is righteous and humble, this HERO asserts an undeniable presence with lines like \"Where I sit, and the path I walk is the answer.\"\n\nThe performance emphasizes freestyle dance, bringing fresh and hip vibes compared to previous routines. The key move of 'DUH!' was created by INTAK, while SOUL contributed to the choreography in the final chorus, further highlighting P1Harmony\u2019s distinctive style. One of the performance\u2019s highlights of 'DUH!' is how each member interprets the same movements in own unique way, making a dynamic and individualistic freestyle expression.\n\n\u25b7OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL X : https://x.com/P1H_official\n\u25b7OFFICIAL MEMBERS X : https://x.com/P1H_members\n\u25b7OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n\u25b7OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #\ud53c\uc6d0\ud558\ubaa8\ub2c8 #P1H #DUH",

The 8th Mini Album, 'DUH!' introduces a HERO who refuses to be taken for granted, boldly asking, \u201cYou really don\u2019t need us?\u201d and going on strike in response. It flips the idea that heroes must always be noble, instead portraying a bold, free-spirited side of P1Harmony with a playful twist.\n\nThe title track 'DUH!', which shares its name with the album, embodies the album's core message. Built on a vintage beat with a retro-inspired groove, the song merges old-school charm with P1Harmony\u2019s trendsetting vocal style. The title track 'DUH!' is an expression conveying the attitude of \"Who\u2019s the big shot here? Of course, it\u2019s me! Isn\u2019t that obvious?\" and playfully showcases a more self-assured and bold version of the HERO. Unlike the traditional HERO, who is righteous and humble, this HERO asserts an undeniable presence with lines like \"Where I sit, and the path I walk is the answer.\"\n\nThe performance emphasizes freestyle dance, bringing fresh and hip vibes compared to previous routines. The key move of 'DUH!' was created by INTAK, while SOUL contributed to the choreography in the final chorus, further highlighting P1Harmony\u2019s distinctive style. One of the performance\u2019s highlights of 'DUH!' is how each member interprets the same movements in own unique way, making a dynamic and individualistic freestyle expression.\n\n\u25b7OFFICIAL WEBSITE : https://www.fncent.com/P1Harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL WEVERSE : https://www.weverse.io/p1harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL X : https://x.com/P1H_official\n\u25b7OFFICIAL MEMBERS X : https://x.com/P1H_members\n\u25b7OFFICIAL INSTAGRAM : https://www.instagram.com/p1h_official\n\u25b7OFFICIAL FACEBOOK : https://www.facebook.com/P1Harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL TIKTOK : https://www.tiktok.com/@p1harmony\n\u25b7OFFICIAL WEIBO : https://weibo.com/P1Harmony\n\n#P1Harmony #\ud53c\uc6d0\ud558\ubaa8\ub2c8 #P1H #DUH"
