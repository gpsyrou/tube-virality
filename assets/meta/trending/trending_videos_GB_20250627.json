With the Natural Living Skill, Sims can meet their needs outdoors without beds or plumbing. This'll be uncomfortable at first, but Sims will find themselves feeling more at home in nature as they improve the skill. Sleeping on the ground, relieving themselves in Privy Bushes, and eating food they find while Foraging are some of the ways Sims can meet their needs out among the trees. \n \nThis wonderous world is also home to Fairy Sims. Fairies have stunning wings and can develop fantastical abilities that let them nurture plants, change the moods of others, and a whole lot more. A kindly Fairy might improve a Sim's luck, while one that's feeling mischievous might bestow an Ailment. Fairies also produce Fairy Dust, which any Sim can use to enchant plants or bring Gnomes to life. Fairy Dust can also be found in the world. \n \nAnother way for any Sim to get a taste of the mystical is through the Apothecary Skill, which allows you to craft useful Elixirs as well as Cures for Ailments. Ailments happen when Sims are unbalanced, and the effects are not always negative but they can be quite curious. For example, one Ailment will attract tons of Gnomes to the afflicted Sim's lot and another improves a Sim's luck by leeching good luck from everyone around them. \n \nAvailable July 10 at 10AM PT on EA App PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation\u00ae4, and PlayStation\u00ae5.

Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY\u00ae Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani\u2019s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY\u00ae Award nod in the category of \u201cBest Urban Contemporary Album.\u201d On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork\u2019s \u201cThe 50 Best Albums of 2017\u201d and Rolling Stone\u2019s \u201c20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.\u201d \n\nAlong the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B\u2019s double-platinum \u201cRing,\u201d Kyle\u2019s platinum \u201cPLAYINWITME,\u201d and Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cGet Me,\u201d to name a few.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It\u2019s the only channel where you\u2019ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more.

Claimsline Group Ltd is a claims management company. Any solicitor we recommend you to is an independent professional from whom you will receive impartial and confidential advice. You are free to choose another solicitor. Claimsline Group Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of regulated claims management activities FRN Number is 831196. ***Free Agreement Check refers only to the live soft-credit check completed online to identify your car finance agreements. *Where No Win, No Fee is offered - You pay nothing unless your claim is successful. A fee between 18 - 36% incl Vat applies on successful claims (fee dependant on level of redress secured), and a cancellation fee may apply outside the 14 day cooling-off period. You do not need to use a claims management company to make a claim; you can do this yourself for free by contacting the car dealership or finance provider and if that is not successful you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. We may receive a fee for introducing you to a third party/panel solicitor, this does not affect any compensation you may receive. Where past redress is mentioned Christopher and Joanne Doran were awarded all sales commission they paid plus interest (76% of their premium) through legal action. This differed from the standard FCA guidelines that typically only allowed consumers to reclaim commission in excess of 50% of the premium. However, this represents a single case rather than a systematic comparison of outcomes",

Claimsline Group Ltd is a claims management company. Any solicitor we recommend you to is an independent professional from whom you will receive impartial and confidential advice. You are free to choose another solicitor. Claimsline Group Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of regulated claims management activities FRN Number is 831196. ***Free Agreement Check refers only to the live soft-credit check completed online to identify your car finance agreements. *Where No Win, No Fee is offered - You pay nothing unless your claim is successful. A fee between 18 - 36% incl Vat applies on successful claims (fee dependant on level of redress secured), and a cancellation fee may apply outside the 14 day cooling-off period. You do not need to use a claims management company to make a claim; you can do this yourself for free by contacting the car dealership or finance provider and if that is not successful you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. We may receive a fee for introducing you to a third party/panel solicitor, this does not affect any compensation you may receive. Where past redress is mentioned Christopher and Joanne Doran were awarded all sales commission they paid plus interest (76% of their premium) through legal action. This differed from the standard FCA guidelines that typically only allowed consumers to reclaim commission in excess of 50% of the premium. However, this represents a single case rather than a systematic comparison of outcomes"
