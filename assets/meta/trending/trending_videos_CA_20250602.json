                "description": "In a spectacular military and propganda coup, Ukraine has carried out an audacious attack on Russia\u2019s airforce, using drones to destroy as many as 40 warplanes at military bases across the country.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called \"Spider's Web\" operation by the SBU security service.  They were smuggled into Russia hidden in wooden mobile cabins, moved close to the airbases, then launched by remote control.  Ukrainian sources told BBC News it had taken 18 months to plan and carry out the operation. \n\nRussia confirmed the Ukrainian attacks, calling them a \"terrorist act\".   Ukraine claims it caused $7bn in damage and destroyed many of Russia\u2019s strategic bomber aircraft. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Paul Adams and Ellie Price.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 what's Rovos Rail? \n01:46 Day 1: train station & boarding\n05:15 day 2: full train tour\n13:50 Zimbabwe boarder \n17:30 Day 3: our Deluxe Suite tour\n24:28 no cell phones allowed\n26:23 Zimbabwe excursion!\n28:29 Day 4 train safari through Hwange Park\n31:36 game drive!\n34:25 this makes me lol\n36:07 Day 5: swimming above Victoria Falls\n41:09 bloops",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 what's Rovos Rail? \n01:46 Day 1: train station & boarding\n05:15 day 2: full train tour\n13:50 Zimbabwe boarder \n17:30 Day 3: our Deluxe Suite tour\n24:28 no cell phones allowed\n26:23 Zimbabwe excursion!\n28:29 Day 4 train safari through Hwange Park\n31:36 game drive!\n34:25 this makes me lol\n36:07 Day 5: swimming above Victoria Falls\n41:09 bloops"

                "description": "This is the definitive review of the new, 1064-hp C8 Corvette ZR1, together with every previous-generation ZR1 (the C4, C6, and C7.) Also featuring the Lamborghini Revuelto, Ferrari 296 GTS and Ferrari SF90. Starring Jason Cammisa and Randy Pobst, the episode also includes drag races and track battles with the C4 Corvette ZR-1, the C6 ZR1, and the C7 ZR1, as well as a Ferrari 348 Serie Speciale.\n\n===\nINSURANCE QUOTE: Visit https://hagerty.com/jason\n\nSPECIAL THANKS to Falcon Car Rental!   https://falconcarrental.com\nUse coupon code HAGERTY for: \n5% off a 1- to 6-day rental!\n20% off a 7- to 27-day rental!\n35% off any rental 28 days or longer!\n===\n\nThe brand new 2025 and 2026 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 packs a 1064-hp punch from its twin-turbocharged 5.5-liter LT7 V-8. It wears the largest turbochargers ever fitted to a production passenger-car engine. This flat-plane-crank V-8 shares its architecture with the Corvette Z06's naturally aspirated LT6,. Cammisa's non-ZTK-package test car has the optional aero kit, but not the track suspension and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2R tires from the Z06. Instead, it's wearing Michelin Pilot Sport 4S (PS4S) tires with a more livable suspension to take its place as the do-everything Corvette.\n\nAnd it starts with speed \u2014\u00a0through the quarter-mile, we recorded 9.8 seconds at 146 mph, making this (by a significant margin) the quickest two-wheel drive car we've ever tested. \n\nThe ZR1 badge means \"King of the Hill\" in Corvette-speak, and was invented as a competition package for the C3 Corvette. In 1989, the 1990 Corvette ZR-1 debuted as the first to wear the badge \u2014 and was immediately called The Corvette From Hell. It was the fastest accelerating car in the land, and the second-fastest car you could buy in America. But it wasn't a one-trick pony, breaking records for lap times, lateral grip, and braking distances by using technology to improve its performance. Its 5.7-liter LT5 engine was designed by Lotus, built by Mercury Marine, and featured 4 camshafts and 32 valves \u2014 something no Corvette had until the LT6/LT7 Gemini twins in the C8. \n\nIn this episode, we race the C4 ZR-1 against the mid-engine Ferrari of the moment, the 348 (and a Serie Speciale, to boot.) The performance wasn't even close \u2014 the Ferrari is a magnificent piece of engineering, but the Corvette beat it in every measure. \n\n15 years later came the C6 Corvette ZR1, known internally initially as the Blue Devil. It featured a supercharged 6.2-liter LS9 V-8 that made 638 hp. Once again, the ZR1 badge stood for bandwidth, meaning the ZR1 did it all: it once again broke records for handling and braking, and lap times to boot, with a Laguna Seca lap record set by our very own, SCCA Hall of Fame race-car driver, and cohost Randy Pobst.\n\nThe C7 Corvette ZR1, which came 10 full years later, was born into a different time, where Ferraris had gained turbochargers and got serious about speed. The C7 ZR1 used the 6.2-liter LT5, supercharged to 755 hp, to keep pace with the newly turbocharged mid-engine Ferraris, specifically the 488. In trying to keep up, the C7 proved difficult to handle, and spelled the end of the front-engine Corvette.\n\nThe C8 is an entirely different animal, and with its mid-mounted, flat-plane-crankshaft V-8 and mandatory dual-clutch automatic, closely resembles Ferrari's recipe. Which, now, Lamborghini is copying with the forthcoming Temerario. So, to all those saying the C8 is an American Ferrari, Jason suggests it's far more like an American Lamborghini \u2014 complete major power and brash looks. \n\nAnd besides, Ferrari has moved away, with the 296 GTB and GTS using a 120-degree V-6 in place of the high-revving flat-plane-crank V-8 that Ferrari invented. \n\nSo how does the C8 ZR1 stack up? Watch and find out: 3 drag races, multiple power slides, drifts, burnouts, and even some low-speed city driving. We cover it all on this award-winning ICONS series.\n\n\nContact us:\nSuggestions and feedback - videoquestions@hagerty.com\nPress inquiries - press@hagerty.com\nPartnership requests - partnerships@hagerty.com",

In trying to keep up, the C7 proved difficult to handle, and spelled the end of the front-engine Corvette.\n\nThe C8 is an entirely different animal, and with its mid-mounted, flat-plane-crankshaft V-8 and mandatory dual-clutch automatic, closely resembles Ferrari's recipe. Which, now, Lamborghini is copying with the forthcoming Temerario. So, to all those saying the C8 is an American Ferrari, Jason suggests it's far more like an American Lamborghini \u2014 complete major power and brash looks. \n\nAnd besides, Ferrari has moved away, with the 296 GTB and GTS using a 120-degree V-6 in place of the high-revving flat-plane-crank V-8 that Ferrari invented. \n\nSo how does the C8 ZR1 stack up? Watch and find out: 3 drag races, multiple power slides, drifts, burnouts, and even some low-speed city driving. We cover it all on this award-winning ICONS series.\n\n\nContact us:\nSuggestions and feedback - videoquestions@hagerty.com\nPress inquiries - press@hagerty.com\nPartnership requests - partnerships@hagerty.com"
