Fuck that I just shoot shit\nI've never been robbed you bozo\nAnd im outside see me walking dolo\nIf a man ever try touch my chain\nLeave em looking like the Jordan logo\nI didn't even need to discuss with the fans\nThey can already see how many lies you told\nSaid he hasn't heard from me since the 90's\nJonah I was 9 years old\nAll I had to was post one tweet\nNow you and all of your guys exposed\nYou should say thank you\nI saw the spike in your streams\nLets talk about the highs and lows\nI'm cooler than hametan\nA traveller pull up in a caravan\nIf you left the country\nMight learn a lot when you spend a day in the UK with the gang\nNever race a Jamaican\nNever fight a Nigerian\nNever ride your bike into a Turkish man\nNever rob an Albanian\nNever diss a Somali\nNever go bar to bar with an English man\nCus I got bars that can fuck up your future\nIts a fist fight I came with a bazooka\nAll you could do now is watch me win\nYou could never be headline you lollapalooza\nDelusions of grandeur\nYour lost in the sauce\nGet back in the real world\nGet off the computer\nYour father gave you all the gems\nNow you turn round saying you don't want to be Junior\nThat's what's killing black men\nYou said your managers from the ends\nWhy does he talk like that then?\nWhen you said I wish I was American\nI was more confused then your managers accent\nNovelist dissed you\nHolla back then\nChip Scorch Cruz Duppy and Smila\nThe kwengadem live\nWhen its time to attack them\nBest in the world, better mention the mandem!",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
