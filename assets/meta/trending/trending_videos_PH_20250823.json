Bigger stakes.\ud83d\udd25\n\nSet during the rise of the Republic, QUEZON is the untold story of the man who dared to declare himself the nation \u2014 and the power struggle that changed history. Starring #JerichoRosales, #BenjaminAlves, #MonConfiado, #IainGlen, #ArronVillaflor, Cris Villanueva, Romnick Sarmenta, #Karylle, JC Santos, Jake Macapagal, Bodjie Pascua, Angeli Bayani, Jojit Lorenzo, Joross Gamboa, Therese Malvar, Ana Abad Santos, Ketchup Eusebio, and Nico Locco.\n\nThe epic end to the #Bayaniverse trilogy begins. Watch #Quezon exclusively in cinemas October 15, 2025.\n\nOfficial Synopsis:\nWhen his fight for Philippine independence from the United States is put to the test, Manuel L. Quezon finds himself playing the brutal game of politics to outmaneuver his rivals\u2014including Leonard Wood, Sergio Osme\u00f1a, and Joven Hernando. In his relentless quest for power, he eventually faces off with Emilio Aguinaldo in the 1935 Philippine presidential elections, using charm and favoritism as both weapons and currency, in a campaign that ultimately changes the face of Philippine politics and history.\n\nSubscribe to TBA Studios YouTube channel: http://bit.ly/TBAStudios\nVisit our Official Website: https://www.tba.ph\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TBAStudiosPH\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TBAStudiosPH\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TBAStudiosP",

                "description": "Bertie Gregory heads to the Azores, a remote island chain in the Atlantic Ocean. Surrounded by Europe\u2019s largest marine protected area, these waters are a vital stop for migrating predators, drawn here by rich feeding grounds. It\u2019s the perfect time for Bertie to capture a rare natural spectacle\u2014when elusive predators unite to hunt dense shoals of fish called bait balls. But with unpredictable storms, filming won\u2019t be easy. During his journey, Bertie also explores the region\u2019s dark history of marine exploitation. By meeting an ex-whaler turned whale spotter, he discovers how the end of whaling transformed the Azores into a sanctuary, allowing marine life to return and delicate food chains to thrive.\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: http://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAnd check out more National Geographic series and specials here:\n\u27a1 Disney Plus: https://on.natgeo.com/3q6on5p\n\u27a1 Hulu: https://on.natgeo.com/3Qor0Ko\n\u27a1 NGTV app: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/\n\u27a1 ABC app: https://abc.com/\n\n#NationalGeographic #BertieGregory #Dolphins\n\nAbout National Geographic:\nNational Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

Are you sad?\nAre you always gonna hate me for that night in Tokyo? \nWhen it ended \nI kinda hoped that it\u2019d be open ended\nBut you never looked back \nWell I guess you can\u2019t hold on to something once you let it go \nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI guess that I\u2019m taking what I can get \n\u2018Cause I don\u2019t get nothing new from your friends \nIf you got the harder side of the break \nThen why is it harder for me to take \nThere\u2019s so much I might never get to say, ay\nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI-I-I know it\u2019s only in my mind\nPlaying three nights on the stereo\nLike a movie scene, DiCaprio \nOh l-I-I put my make up on just to fall asleep\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is something we\u2019ll never be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nCan we be friends at least\n\nCredits:\nStarring.\nLalisa Manobal\nKentaro Sakaguchi\n\nA film by ARFILM @arfilm_ojun\nWritten & Directed by OJun Kwon\n\nAssistant Director.
