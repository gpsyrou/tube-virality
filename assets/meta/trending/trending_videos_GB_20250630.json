Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It\u2019s the only channel where you\u2019ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It\u2019s the only channel where you\u2019ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard."

                "description": "FNaF World is one of my favorite free games ever made, but unfortunately my bank account is in the negative so I can\u2019t afford anything free anymore. I went to Vegas last month and bet my entire savings account (and then some!) on black, thinking my YouTuber luck would carry over. Spoiler alert, it didn\u2019t. Thankfully, I can still play the FNaF World Demo even though I\u2019m in debt, so here I am trying to figure out a way to make content out of it. I guess I haven\u2019t made the obligatory 100%ing FNaF World video yet like everyone else, so now I\u2019ve decided to try and 100% the game with the added twist of doing it inside of the FNaF World Demo. This seems a lot simpler than it truly was however, as many literal barriers are found within the world halting your progress, and you can\u2019t even use most of the characters! I would say if this video does well I can pay off my debts, but I actually think I already have in the process of making this! I think my terrible luck with pokemon cards finally decided to go away, as the other day I opened a booster bundle of Prismatic Evolutions and pulled a beautiful Eevee EX SIR, which is worth about 140 dollars. I haven\u2019t really told any of my friends that I pulled the card though, so if you\u2019re reading this I guess you\u2019ve got some elite TheDapperWaffle knowledge to totally impress your friends!

I think my terrible luck with pokemon cards finally decided to go away, as the other day I opened a booster bundle of Prismatic Evolutions and pulled a beautiful Eevee EX SIR, which is worth about 140 dollars. I haven\u2019t really told any of my friends that I pulled the card though, so if you\u2019re reading this I guess you\u2019ve got some elite TheDapperWaffle knowledge to totally impress your friends!
