It was nice having a game to play and enjoy that didn't involve fighting people or spending money, but I guess good things can't last forever. I talked to a few hardcore fischers to make sure everything in the video is as accurate as possible, if there's some misinformation or something I missed, I'll point it out in the description or just cut it out\n\nLinks\u2b07\ufe0f\n-----\nGame link: https://www.roblox.com/games/16732694052/Fisch\n-----\nGame Discord: https://discord.com/invite/fisch\n-----\nGroup: https://www.roblox.com/groups/16873472/theholygrails-gang#!/store\n-----\nFisch wiki: https://fischipedia.org/wiki/Fisch_Wiki\n-----\nMy discord/guilded server:\nhttps://discord.gg/theholygrail75\nhttps://www.guilded.gg/theholygrail75\n-----\nmusic credits:\nPhilip Milman \u25ba https://www.pmmusic.pro/\nPokemon B2W2 Ghetsis theme\nPokemon B2W2 Kyurem theme\nDragon Ball Daima A Mighty Foe\nOnett - Wax\nPokemon LA Legendary Theme\nAnimal Crossing 12PM\n\n0:00 they blew it\n1:26 the main issue\n3:28 paid luck boosting insanity\n9:20 skins & limited items\n12:12 questionable sales\n13:14 pay 2 win eggs lol\n14:41 why I quit",

It was nice having a game to play and enjoy that didn't involve fighting people or spending money, but I guess good things can't last forever. I talked to a few hardcore fischers to make sure everything in the video is as accurate as possible, if there's some misinformation or something I missed, I'll point it out in the description or just cut it out\n\nLinks\u2b07\ufe0f\n-----\nGame link: https://www.roblox.com/games/16732694052/Fisch\n-----\nGame Discord: https://discord.com/invite/fisch\n-----\nGroup: https://www.roblox.com/groups/16873472/theholygrails-gang#!/store\n-----\nFisch wiki: https://fischipedia.org/wiki/Fisch_Wiki\n-----\nMy discord/guilded server:\nhttps://discord.gg/theholygrail75\nhttps://www.guilded.gg/theholygrail75\n-----\nmusic credits:\nPhilip Milman \u25ba https://www.pmmusic.pro/\nPokemon B2W2 Ghetsis theme\nPokemon B2W2 Kyurem theme\nDragon Ball Daima A Mighty Foe\nOnett - Wax\nPokemon LA Legendary Theme\nAnimal Crossing 12PM\n\n0:00 they blew it\n1:26 the main issue\n3:28 paid luck boosting insanity\n9:20 skins & limited items\n12:12 questionable sales\n13:14 pay 2 win eggs lol\n14:41 why I quit"

A large pride of twenty lions lay spread out on the bank of a dry riverbed.\n\nThe pride consists of a mature male, several lionesses and cubs of various ages. Renowned for their strength, both individually and collectively, you would think that nothing would disturb their late morning nap.\n\nWhile most of the pride rested peacefully, three of them either heard or smelt something that got their attention. Moving away from the group, they went to investigate.\n\nSubsequently, rising up from the riverbed, appeared a young, lone elephant bull.\n\nOn reaching maturity, male elephants leave their natal herds, so this was not unusual in itself. But more about that later.\n\nAs the oversized gate-crasher came into view, the three lions tensed up. Lions are known to prey on lone elephants in some places, but seldom in Kruger Park.\n\nAnd it would be no different on this day. Seeing that the bull was heading directly towards them, the three lions gave way.\n\nIt was clear that the elephant was well aware of the lions' presence. Ears flared and head held upright, the bull lengthened his stride as he made straight towards them.\n\nWhen he got within twenty metres of the pride, he pulled up to assess the situation. And, to give the big cats a chance to leave of their own accord.\n\nIn response, some members of the pride got to their feet and sauntered off. Meanwhile, others remained where they were, not ready to exert themselves until the bull made his next move.\n\nNot impressed by the lions' failure to give way immediately, the elephant took things up a notch. Showing surprising acceleration, the bull charged, trumpeting loudly as he did.\n\nEvery member of the pride, from the dominant male to the youngest cub, immediately took off in the opposite direction.\n\nSoon enough, the elephant decided that he had made his point. Pulling up, once again, he tracked the movement of a lioness who had splintered from the pride in the chaos.\n\nLater, satisfied that she too did not dispute his supremacy, the bull ripped up a tussock of grass to chew on.\n\nApparently not liking the taste of his snack, he promptly wandered off.\nAs for the lions, seeing their tormentor waddle off without a care in the world, they soon returned to where they had lain earlier.\n\nIf lions could talk, you can be sure none of them was about to mention anything about being 'king of the jungle'.\n\nIn both lion and elephant communities, adult males play little to no role in raising their offspring. Their contribution in this respect is limited to security and DNA. In both instances, when they reach sexual maturity, they are forced (generally by dominant males in the area) to leave their mothers.\nUsually, they will band with other males to form bachelor groups or alliances, from which they derive mutual protection. This affords them an environment in which to grow stronger and wiser, thereby enhancing their chances of reproductive success when fully matured.\n\nNo doubt, this young bull's experience will have helped build his confidence, shaping his character for a long life ahead.\n \nTo license the footage: \nContact@LatestSightings.com\n\nSnapchat: LatestSightings\nTwitter & Instagram: @LatestKruger\n\nFor live wildlife sightings in the Kruger National Park: http://www.latestsightings.com/\n\nAnd like our Facebook page for great sightings and photos: https://www.facebook.com/latestsightingskruger\n\nSubscribe to us on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/LatestSightings",
