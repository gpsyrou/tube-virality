ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d).

It features a iconic German fighter pilot from WWI versus a legendary Finnish military sniper from WWII. It just felt like a perfect matchup for an ERB video and it's great to focus on two characters who are somewhat lesser known around the world.\n\nHuge thanks as always to our wonderful patrons for all their support!

Epic Rap Battles Of History. \nBRAND NEW ERB MERCH OUT NOW: https://www.erbmerch.com\nListen to this track on all streaming platforms: \u25ba https://tinyurl.com/mrx7cy85\n\nWatch the Behind The Scenes video now: \u25ba http://www.youtube.com/erb2\n\nIf you are looking for autographed memorabilia we have the ERB Vinyl Record and six poster designs in stock right now over on our merch site: \u25ba https://www.erbmerch.com \n\nRed Baron vs White Death has been a match-up pairing that's been kicking around for a few years now. It features a iconic German fighter pilot from WWI versus a legendary Finnish military sniper from WWII. It just felt like a perfect matchup for an ERB video and it's great to focus on two characters who are somewhat lesser known around the world.\n\nHuge thanks as always to our wonderful patrons for all their support! Special thanks to \"Crabcakes\" for pushing for this matchup so hard in recent years. Your persistence paid off!
