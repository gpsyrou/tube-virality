By walking the world, running real statistical surveys, and then checking the game files, I compared my guesses (and those of a bunch of other creators) to the actual number, with $10,000 going to charity for whoever came closest.\n\npatreon- https://www.patreon.com/any_austin\nbsky- https://bsky.app/profile/anyaustin.bsky.social\ndiscord- https://discord.gg/0wLFXHCpjmnrwCvJ\ninstagram- https://www.instagram.com/any_austin/\ntwitch- https://www.twitch.tv/any_austin\nTikTok- https://tiktok.com/@any_austin\n\nFor my music, search \u201cThe Excellent Man from Minneapolis\u201d on your favorite streaming service, or click here for Spotify- https://open.spotify.com/artist/49RPyTk0BluLrg3scWFCOw\n\nEnglish, French, and German captions provided by Lawrence."

Is This the Start of Real Alien Disclosure? Steven Spielberg is BACK in the sci-fi game with \"Disclosure Day\" \u2013 his mysterious new extraterrestrial thriller starring Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, and more! The cryptic marketing (those viral bird silhouette posters and upside-down eye billboards) had everyone buzzing, and now the official teaser trailer just dropped... and it's CHILLING! In this video, I dive deep into the promo materials, react to the eerie teaser (crop circles, strange animal behavior, Emily Blunt's meteorologist channeling something otherworldly live on air), and break down what this could mean for UFO/UAP disclosure in real life. Could Spielberg's film be timing perfectly with current government hearings and the \"Age of Disclosure\"?
