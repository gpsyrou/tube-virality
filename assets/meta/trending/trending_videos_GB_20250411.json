His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n\u25bahttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ \u25bahttps://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n\u25bahttps://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\u25bahttps://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson",

His wit and dry sense of humor appeal to children and adults alike. A product of the millennial generation, his appreciation of new technology blends with his old-fashioned work ethic, and he offers a unique ability to deliver his message in a way that resonates with lifelong farmers as well as those with no knowledge of agriculture. With growing consumer awareness about where their food comes from, Zach has identified the need for an independent voice from the front lines of agriculture. Zach actively promotes agriculture by sharing his day-to-day experiences in the agriculture world while providing farmer-to-farmer education to help facilitate a collaborative conversation between farmers and the public. \nFollow Along \n\u25bahttps://www.instagram.com/mnmillennialfarmer/ \u25bahttps://www.facebook.com/MNMILLENNIALFARMER/ \n\u25bahttps://twitter.com/farmmillennial \n\u25bahttps://www.tiktok.com/@millennialfarmer\n\nEdited By: Becky Johnson"
