                "description": "A film by Steven Spielberg. Disclosure Day is in theaters 06.12.26.\n\nIf you found out we weren\u2019t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. \nWe are coming close to \u2026 Disclosure Day. \n\nUniversal Pictures is proud to release a new original event film created and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars SAG winner and Oscar\u00ae nominee Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place), Emmy and Golden Globe winner Josh O\u2019Connor (Challengers, The Crown), Oscar\u00ae winner Colin Firth (The King\u2019s Speech, Kingsman franchise), Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) and two-time Oscar\u00ae nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nBased on a story by Spielberg, the screenplay is by David Koepp, whose previous work with Spielberg includes the scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Combined, those films earned more than $3 billion worldwide. Koepp also wrote the script for this 2025\u2019s Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nDisclosure Day is produced by five-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (The Fabelmans, West Side Story) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. \n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the industry\u2019s most successful and influential filmmakers. The top-grossing director of all time, Spielberg has helmed such blockbusters as Jaws, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park. \n \nAmong his myriad honors, he is a three-time Academy Award\u00ae winner, including Oscars\u00ae for Best Director and Best Picture for Schindler\u2019s List, which received a total of seven Oscars\u00ae, and for Best Director for Saving Private Ryan. His most recent film, The Fabelmans, was released by Universal in 2022 and received seven Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including for Directing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture. \n\nWebsite: http://disclosuredaymovie.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/disclosuredayfilm/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disclosureday/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en\nX: https://x.com/disclosureday\nHashtag: #DisclosureDay",

I need to prove that I have the skills and work my way up the Minecraft Manhunt ladder.\n\nFollow my socials:\n\u27bd Twitter - @dream\n\u27bd Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n\u27bd Snapchat - @dream\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound   \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is ONE hunter, but I am NOT allowed to wear any armor. Not a single piece. \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.10 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\nMusic is from: @dreamproductionsXD \n\n#MinecraftManhunt",

I need to prove that I have the skills and work my way up the Minecraft Manhunt ladder.\n\nFollow my socials:\n\u27bd Twitter - @dream\n\u27bd Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n\u27bd Snapchat - @dream\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound   \n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is ONE hunter, but I am NOT allowed to wear any armor. Not a single piece. \n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.10 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friend George tries to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\nMusic is from: @dreamproductionsXD \n\n#MinecraftManhunt"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
