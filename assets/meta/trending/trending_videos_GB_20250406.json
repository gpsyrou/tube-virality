And this time she\u2019s not alone. \n\nThe original creative team behind that phenomenon\u2014led by horror titans James Wan for Atomic Monster, Jason Blum for Blumhouse and writer-director Gerard Johnstone\u2014reboot an all-new wild chapter in A.I. mayhem with M3GAN 2.0. Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on\na murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently\ndestroyed, M3GAN\u2019s creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma\u2019s niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma\u2019s overprotective rules.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia\u2019s self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. \n\nWith the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I icon is about to meet her match.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 is written and directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Gerard Johnstone, from a story by Gerard Johnstone and Akela Cooper, based on characters created by Akela Cooper & James Wan.\n\nThe film co-stars returning cast members Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps as Gemma\u2019s loyal tech teammates, Cole and Tess, and new characters played by Aristotle Athari (Saturday Night Live, Hacks), Timm Sharp (Apples Never Fall, Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement (Avatar: The Way of Water, What We Do in the Shadows). \n\nProduced by James Wan, Jason Blum and Allison Williams, the film is executive produced by Gerard Johnstone, Adam Hendricks, Greg Gilreath, Michael Clear, Judson Scott and Mark D. Katchur. \n\nThe first M3GAN film shattered box office records, opening to $30.4 million domestically to become the biggest opening weekend for a PG-13 horror film since A Quiet Place Part II. The film went on to gross more than $180 million worldwide.",

                "description": "It\u2019s new machine day in the workshop, and we\u2019re taking things to the next level\u2014literally! We\u2019re upgrading to a 6.3-tonne overhead gantry crane with a 17.7-metre span, and this beast is going to change how we move heavy equipment, making our workflow more efficient and lifting jobs safer. Thanks to the crew from Austwide Cranes that allowed us to capture every step of the action on this 3 day installation!\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Day 1 \u2013 Foundations & Structural Setup\nThe Austwide Cranes team arrived early to precisely mark out where everything needed to go using lasers and measuring equipment. They then drilled and installed jacking bolts to secure the crane columns. Then, the steel structure arrived, and things got interesting. With limited access around our big machines, positioning the columns wasn\u2019t straightforward. The team used a forklift with a jib attachment to manoeuvre them into place. For the two most difficult columns, Kurtis jumped in with the yard crane to install them himself. With those locked down, we moved on to lifting and securing the 12-metre-long runway beams\u2014a huge step forward in the build.\n\n\u26a1 Day 2 \u2013 Securing, Power, & Final Adjustments\nNow that the structure was in place, the team focused on securing and levelling everything. They welded end stop mounts to the runway beams and installed the busbar system, which supplies power to the crane along the runway. Then the electrician started running the main power connections, getting everything prepped for the final stage of the installation.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 Day 3 \u2013 The Crane Arrives & Final Installation!\nThe moment we\u2019d been waiting for\u2014the main crane unit arrived, and it was an absolute weapon! Painted in the workshop blue with our logo, it looked f*cken awesome. To do the lift was the crew from Mighty Cranes, who used their AT-20 Terex Franna to handle the job. The install happened in just minutes with the guidance of the Austwide Cranes techs, and before we knew it, the crane was sitting perfectly on the runway structure. But the job wasn\u2019t over yet. The electrician still had to wire up the main power connections and complete the final testing and end limit settings to ensure everything operated safely.\n\nWith the installation done, we finally get to test out our new workshop crane\u2014and what better way than by lifting one of our lathes? This is a game-changer for our workshop, and we\u2019re pumped to see how much easier our heavy lifting jobs will be from now on. What do you think of our new setup?
