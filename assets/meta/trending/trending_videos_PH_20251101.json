Though they emerged in a place and time where trippy psychedelic visions were the order of\u202fthe day, CCR bucked the trends and instead tapped into a rich, traditional seam of American music that connected to blues, country, rockabilly, gospel, folk and R&B.\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\nDuring their short time together as a band (1968 \u2013 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity lead by singer, songwriter, arranger John Fogerty. They\u2019ve sold close to 100 million records, releasing 14 Top 10 hits. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

A strange mine suddenly appears in Avery's world with an odd book in a chest, but as he explores further, Avery finds a tunnel leading to a Minecraft world that shouldn't exist. And he isn't the only thing in this world either...\n\nAvery's Channel:  @averylargemayo \n\n\nDISCLAIMER!! Don't read for spoilers: ----\n\n\nThe ARG in this video is one that I created specifically for this video. Upcoming videos will continue to feature ARGs I find in the wild, but I wanted to experiment with storytelling and see if I can make an entertaining mystery watch myself.\n\nSome fun tidbits about this video - it was made over the course of 4 months and I have some thoughts but I think the second half of the video is both very experimental and very fun to watch. Multiple minutes of no voice over and just music?? Never done that before, hopefully this doesn't age badly. The CIPHER though goodness gracious. The cipher room d3rLord runs into was meant to be almost unsolvable with cipher stacking. But I made the cardinal sin of stacking two substitution ciphers so it can be solved with literally just a basic vigenere. The whole point was to ego boost d3rLord but now he's just yapping about solving a basic shift cipher. Oh well... I also think the whispers in the tunnel might be the worst flaw of this video. I liked the idea in theory but sounds a tad corny. The rest of the vid I really like though.

A strange mine suddenly appears in Avery's world with an odd book in a chest, but as he explores further, Avery finds a tunnel leading to a Minecraft world that shouldn't exist. And he isn't the only thing in this world either...\n\nAvery's Channel:  @averylargemayo \n\n\nDISCLAIMER!! Don't read for spoilers: ----\n\n\nThe ARG in this video is one that I created specifically for this video. Upcoming videos will continue to feature ARGs I find in the wild, but I wanted to experiment with storytelling and see if I can make an entertaining mystery watch myself.\n\nSome fun tidbits about this video - it was made over the course of 4 months and I have some thoughts but I think the second half of the video is both very experimental and very fun to watch. Multiple minutes of no voice over and just music?? Never done that before, hopefully this doesn't age badly. The CIPHER though goodness gracious.

(Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've never felt anything\nLike the love from my final days\nWhy'd you wait\nTo show me you could do it this way?\nWoo, I'll never look at you, look at you the same\nWe met in The Paris caf\u00e9\nI said, \"Can I sit with you? Comment \u00e7a se fait?\"\nMy mistake\nIf I'd known it would have been this way\nI'd never looked at you, looked in the first place\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWas it always in your plan to leave eventually?\nBecause to me, there's no one else that could make sense to me\nThe last and final puzzle piece\n\n[Chorus]\nIn a room full of people, I look for you\nWould you avoid me or would you look for me too?\nTell me, is our story through? (Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe I'm delusional\nAnd the way you act is usual\nMaybe in another world\nI won't feel so unlovable (Unlovable)\nOh (Unlovable)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn a room full of people, I look for you\nWould you avoid me or would you look for me too?\nTell me, is our story through? (Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\nIn a room full of people, I look for you\nWould you avoid me or would you see me through?\nTell me, is our story through? (Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\n\n.......\n\ud83d\udce7 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n\ud83d\udc8c Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com\n.........\n\ud83d\udcdd Licensing / Sync Requests for 7clouds Releases: licensing@7clouds.org\n.........\n\n#sombr #12to12 #lyrics #7clouds",

(Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI've never felt anything\nLike the love from my final days\nWhy'd you wait\nTo show me you could do it this way?\nWoo, I'll never look at you, look at you the same\nWe met in The Paris caf\u00e9\nI said, \"Can I sit with you? Comment \u00e7a se fait?\"\nMy mistake\nIf I'd known it would have been this way\nI'd never looked at you, looked in the first place\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWas it always in your plan to leave eventually?\nBecause to me, there's no one else that could make sense to me\nThe last and final puzzle piece\n\n[Chorus]\nIn a room full of people, I look for you\nWould you avoid me or would you look for me too?\nTell me, is our story through? (Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\n\n[Bridge]\nMaybe I'm delusional\nAnd the way you act is usual\nMaybe in another world\nI won't feel so unlovable (Unlovable)\nOh (Unlovable)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn a room full of people, I look for you\nWould you avoid me or would you look for me too?\nTell me, is our story through? (Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\nIn a room full of people, I look for you\nWould you avoid me or would you see me through?\nTell me, is our story through? (Through)\nOr do our hearts still beat in tune?\n\n.......\n\ud83d\udce7 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n\ud83d\udc8c Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com\n.........\n\ud83d\udcdd Licensing / Sync Requests for 7clouds Releases: licensing@7clouds.org\n.........\n\n#sombr #12to12 #lyrics #7clouds"

Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects.

There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d).
