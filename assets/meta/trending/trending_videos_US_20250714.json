Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It\u2019s the only channel where you\u2019ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

You also get to write your name on one of the empty books decorating their wall...which is pretty cool...\n\nFOLLOW ME: @BeardMeatsFood\n\nWATCH THE PODCAST: https://www.youtube.com/@BreakingBeardPod\n\nFOLLOW THE PODCAST: @BreakingBeardPod\n\nMERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTED BY SPRING: \n\nUse the merchandise shelf below the video player or the following link - https://bit.ly/3S7VPjP\n\n#FoodChallenge #EatingShow #Pho",

You also get to write your name on one of the empty books decorating their wall...which is pretty cool...\n\nFOLLOW ME: @BeardMeatsFood\n\nWATCH THE PODCAST: https://www.youtube.com/@BreakingBeardPod\n\nFOLLOW THE PODCAST: @BreakingBeardPod\n\nMERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTED BY SPRING: \n\nUse the merchandise shelf below the video player or the following link - https://bit.ly/3S7VPjP\n\n#FoodChallenge #EatingShow #Pho"

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 our 112th country!\n3:08 boarding our boat\n4:00 our room tours\n7:09 boat layout\n10:00 first sunset & meal onboard\n14:50 emotional morning\u2026\n18:15 nate\u2019s big moment!!!\n23:03 kara\u2019s first elephant babies!!!\n26:39 afternoon onboard\n28:42 crocs, hippos, baboons, more elephants\n33:11 day 3\n34:53 last and BEST floating game drive\n35:38 elephant charge!\n36:40 swimming elephants and hippos!",

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 our 112th country!\n3:08 boarding our boat\n4:00 our room tours\n7:09 boat layout\n10:00 first sunset & meal onboard\n14:50 emotional morning\u2026\n18:15 nate\u2019s big moment!!!\n23:03 kara\u2019s first elephant babies!!!\n26:39 afternoon onboard\n28:42 crocs, hippos, baboons, more elephants\n33:11 day 3\n34:53 last and BEST floating game drive\n35:38 elephant charge!\n36:40 swimming elephants and hippos!"

                "description": "Bobby Carter | July 11, 2025\nAfter a 16-year hiatus and with no go-to band in place, Clipse's Tiny Desk took lots of time to piece together. At first, I didn't know exactly what they were looking for, in terms of sonics, but it clicked when I was told what they didn't want: no jazzy renditions of their music. They meant no disrespect to jazz at all, and if you follow the duo's music, it boils down to hard drums and even harder synths. Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better. Here's Clipse delivering its best live performance ever recorded and one of the hardest Tiny Desks of all time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Virginia\"\n\"Keys Open Doors\"\n\"Momma I'm So Sorry\"\n\"Chains & Whips\"\n\"Birds Don't Sing\"\n\"Grindin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPusha T: vocals\nMalice: vocals\nBriley Harris: keys\nDarryl Woodson: keys\nYoo Q!: DJ, background vocals\nDaru Jones: drums\nBrittney Mills: background vocals\nTariq Ali: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better. Here's Clipse delivering its best live performance ever recorded and one of the hardest Tiny Desks of all time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Virginia\"\n\"Keys Open Doors\"\n\"Momma I'm So Sorry\"\n\"Chains & Whips\"\n\"Birds Don't Sing\"\n\"Grindin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPusha T: vocals\nMalice: vocals\nBriley Harris: keys\nDarryl Woodson: keys\nYoo Q!: DJ, background vocals\nDaru Jones: drums\nBrittney Mills: background vocals\nTariq Ali: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.
