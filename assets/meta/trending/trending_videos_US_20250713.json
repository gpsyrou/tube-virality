                "description": "Bobby Carter | July 11, 2025\nAfter a 16-year hiatus and with no go-to band in place, Clipse's Tiny Desk took lots of time to piece together. At first, I didn't know exactly what they were looking for, in terms of sonics, but it clicked when I was told what they didn't want: no jazzy renditions of their music. They meant no disrespect to jazz at all, and if you follow the duo's music, it boils down to hard drums and even harder synths. Hybrid drummer Daru Jones, who played on last year's Tiny Desk for the LOX, was the first choice because of his unique ability to mix traditional and electronic drum sounds. He provided the authenticity needed for this set, and everything else fell into place.\n\nThe excitement for the Thornton brothers' return reached its apex instantly as someone in the crowd yelled \"Oh my god!\" at the opening note of \"Virginia.\" There was no lull as the band coasted through \"Keys Open Doors\" and \"Momma I'm So Sorry,\" from Clipse's most celebrated album, Hell Hath No Fury. I found so much to analyze witnessing the dichotomy between Pusha T and Malice up close. Malice is more collected in his movements, intensely scouring the room with his eyes while his brother is much more animated, even letting out a sinister laugh mid-set.\n\nRecorded weeks ago, the two performed songs from their new album, Let God Sort Em Out, for the first time, including a chilling dedication to their deceased parents, \"Birds Don't Sing.\" Before the tears from the crowd could dry, we got the moment we'd been waiting for in \"Grindin'.\"\n\nThe first half of the year in hip-hop hasn't been the most exciting, so the timing of this reunion couldn't be better. Here's Clipse delivering its best live performance ever recorded and one of the hardest Tiny Desks of all time.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Virginia\"\n\"Keys Open Doors\"\n\"Momma I'm So Sorry\"\n\"Chains & Whips\"\n\"Birds Don't Sing\"\n\"Grindin'\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPusha T: vocals\nMalice: vocals\nBriley Harris: keys\nDarryl Woodson: keys\nYoo Q!: DJ, background vocals\nDaru Jones: drums\nBrittney Mills: background vocals\nTariq Ali: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

A show about bunch of people trapped in a circus-themed VR game with a sinister undertone? This was inevitable really\u2026\nI\u2019ve been a bit reluctant to do songs about animations and TV shows in the past, not just because video games are my comfortable niche, but because part of the fun is taking the world of the video game and trying to recreate it in live-action or animation. I was worried that an animation about\u2026 well, an animation, wouldn\u2019t be particularly transformative, and might seem just like a worse version of the original media. But I hope you\u2019ll agree that the talented team at @HibernateStudios  knocked it out the park and made something that fits beautifully into the world of TADC!\nYou may know Hibernate from their Minecraft animations for @danbull  and they also did the CG portions of Divide! for us last year. If you love this video as much I do, be sure to hop over to their channel and let them know! I\u2019d love to work with them again soon!\nThanks to the amazing TADC voice-actors that lended their voices to our silly little project, we\u2019re thrilled to have them! But in case it wasn\u2019t apparent from the self-insert character, that doesn\u2019t make this an official TADC video - just a fan project.
