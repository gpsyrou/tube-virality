                "description": "You, Me & Tuscany - In Theaters April 10\n\nSometimes the wrong place is right where you need to be. \n\nFrom Will Packer, the blockbuster producer of Girls Trip, the Ride Along franchise, and ten movies that have opened No. 1 at the U.S. box office\u2014including Night School, This Christmas and Think Like a Man\u2014comes a delicious romantic comedy about one little lie, one large Italian villa, and two people getting lost in the sauce of love. \n\nHalle Bailey (The Little Mermaid, The Color Purple) stars as Anna, a young woman who has abandoned her dreams of becoming a chef and is now drifting through her twenties with a series of bad choices. When Anna loses her house-sitting job (and housing) in one fell swoop, a chance encounter with Matteo\u2014a handsome Italian who happens to have a villa sitting empty in Tuscany\u2014will inspire her to jet off for Italy, against the advice of her always-honest bestie, Claire (Home Before Dark\u2019s Aziza Scott).  \n\nBut Anna\u2019s plan to crash at Matteo\u2019s villa, without permission, just for one night, falls apart when Matteo\u2019s mother, Gabriella (Italian film icon Isabella Ferrari) shows up at the house unexpectedly. In a panic, Anna allows Gabriella to believe that she is Matteo\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. \n\nThat little lie becomes a big problem, though, when Matteo\u2019s cousin, Michael (Reg\u00e9-Jean Page; Bridgerton, Black Bag) shows up, and Anna discovers that the heat between them may ignite a fire that will transform her life. \n\nThe film\u2019s international cast includes Lorenzo de Moor (The Legend Hunters) as Matteo, Marco Calvani (The Four Seasons) as an Italian taxi driver who befriends Anna and Academy Award\u00ae nominee Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) as Anna\u2019s house-sitting client, Mrs. Dunn.  \n\nYou, Me & Tuscany is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Kat Coiro (Marry Me, Matlock), from a screenplay by Ryan Engle (Rampage, Beast), based on an original idea by Ryan Engle and Kristin Engle. The film is produced by Will Packer (Girls Trip, Ride Along films) and Johanna Byer (Point Blank, executive producer Praise This) for Will Packer Productions. The executive producers are Ryan Engle and Kristin Engle.\n\nSocial Handles\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/youmetuscany \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/youmetuscany \nX: https://x.com/youmetuscany \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@youmetuscany \nThreads: https://www.threads.com/@youmetuscany\nOfficial Site: www.YouMeTuscanyMovie.com\n#YouMeTuscany",

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
