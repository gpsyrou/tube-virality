And welcome to the 7-Eleven haul of my dreams!! Now, on our previous trips to East Asia, we definitely noticed the prevalence of 7-Elevens pretty much everywhere - and not only were we surprised by how widespread and popular they were - we quickly realized, they had a lot of pretty awesome stuff we don\u2019t have in the states - like, baos, teas, sandos, noodles, iced coffees, unique chip flavors, pancake sandwiches, corn ice cream - and more!! And once we returned - I started to notice how many people online were also going to international 7-Elevens and doing snack hauls - and I realized - this is a convenience store movement!! \n\nSo on our travels over the past year, we\u2019ve collected 7-Eleven tours and hauls in each country we visited - Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan\u2026 to try out some viral snacks, and generally compare them, but also mostly just to feast!

                "description": "Iran has launched mass new strikes on Israel.  It says it attacked dozens of targets including military centres and airbases. \u00a0 Smoke has been seen rising over the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv and there have been explosions in Jerusalem. \u00a0\n\nThe  bombardment is in retaliation for Israel's strikes on Iran, hitting military and nuclear sites.   It says it hit a nuclear facility in Isfahan following earlier strikes on the country's biggest nuclear facility at Natanz .Israel said the attacks were vital to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. \u00a0\n\nIran\u2019s spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, promised his country would 'inflict heavy blows' in response.\n\u00a0\nThere are warnings the conflict could escalate into all-out war.  \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson, Ione Wells, Frank Gardner, Tom Bateman, Gary O\u2019Donoghue and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

It says it attacked dozens of targets including military centres and airbases. \u00a0 Smoke has been seen rising over the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv and there have been explosions in Jerusalem. \u00a0\n\nThe  bombardment is in retaliation for Israel's strikes on Iran, hitting military and nuclear sites.   It says it hit a nuclear facility in Isfahan following earlier strikes on the country's biggest nuclear facility at Natanz .Israel said the attacks were vital to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. \u00a0\n\nIran\u2019s spiritual leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, promised his country would 'inflict heavy blows' in response.\n\u00a0\nThere are warnings the conflict could escalate into all-out war.  \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson, Ione Wells, Frank Gardner, Tom Bateman, Gary O\u2019Donoghue and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 what is Global Airlines?\n01:20 check in/lounge\n02:49 boarding A380 from the ground\n05:30 caviar party\n08:11 our Daily Drop SUMMER SALE!!\n11:35 meal service \n12:57 slammer time with the founder\n13:32 first class seat review \n14:48 how much does it cost to run an A380?\n18:27 bathroom tour/amenity kit ;)\n21:30 visiting upstairs business class\n22:56 addressing the negative reviews\n24:00 first class bed conversion\n24:54 final thoughts \n27:08 bloops :)",

We flew on Global Airlines first ever flight from Manchester Airport to JFK, New York in first class! This airline was started buy a guy who we've followed on instagram for years and had never met...until today ;)\n\nHuge thanks to James and the Global Airlines team for having us on this unforgettable flight! (and for giving us 50% off our tickets!)\n\nEpisode 962 | Filmed May 2025\n\nSubscribe to our new friend \u00a0@jameswarrenolivertravelexpert\u00a0 :)\n https://youtu.be/W92wnw7Ytq8?si=yj_Jm5asGT03YMJo \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWho are Kara and Nate?! \n\n2016-2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s \n\n2020-2024: https://youtu.be/ikAN9e0gBaU?si=G644UGWIqPrOzTYW\n\nOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super \u201cnormal.\u201d I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. \n\nWe discovered the world of \u201ctravel hacking\u201d while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)\n\nSo after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a \u201cone year\u201d trip around the world.\n\nOur goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to \u201cnormal life.\u201d We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udfa5\ud83c\udf0e Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 what is Global Airlines?\n01:20 check in/lounge\n02:49 boarding A380 from the ground\n05:30 caviar party\n08:11 our Daily Drop SUMMER SALE!!\n11:35 meal service \n12:57 slammer time with the founder\n13:32 first class seat review \n14:48 how much does it cost to run an A380?\n18:27 bathroom tour/amenity kit ;)\n21:30 visiting upstairs business class\n22:56 addressing the negative reviews\n24:00 first class bed conversion\n24:54 final thoughts \n27:08 bloops :)"
