                "description": "#FastAndFurious11 #VinDiesel #DwayneJohnson\n\nWatch This Fast & Furious 11 Fan Made Concept Trailer\n\nVin Diesel's Dom Toretto must ultimately confront his destiny as the Fast & Furious franchise approaches its explosive conclusion, with every main character coming together for one last ride that takes place around the world and pushes the limits of physics the series has already pushed. Dom has taken down international crime syndicates and government conspiracy after ten movies; however, he finds himself facing the only foe that cannot be outrun \u2013 his past in the form of foes who have come together specifically to destroy the family that has endured impossible odds through sheer willpower and quarter mile loyalty. Dwayne Johnson will return to the role of Luke Hobbs after years of on-screen tension with Vin Diesel as Hobbs comes to the aid of Dom for the final time since the stakes have grown too large for the family to overcome on its own. Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw completes the three-man team of the most elite warriors that must work together when a new foe emerges with the resources and ferocity of the previous villains were mere speed bumps.\n\nThe level of action goes completely overboard with both practical stunts and CGI spectacle combining for a variety of set pieces including cars being dropped from space, highways filled with military vehicles and Dom performing stunts that would be deemed impossible in previous films. There will be true emotional depth as characters that began as street racers and are now globe-trotting heroes face mortality and legacy, asking themselves if their chosen family will survive the final war intact. The competitive energy channeled into mutual respect by Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham due to their experience working together as a team to face danger together shows that sometimes the best teams are formed from individuals who have been adversaries at some point in the past. The reason why this movie is unique is because it understands that everything eventually comes to an end \u2013 the film provides massive spectacle while also paying tribute to the individual character arcs developed over twenty years and brings back many faces you may have forgotten existed for moments that truly warrant nostalgia rather than using it for fan service.\n\nExpect cameos from all previous films, returns that serve the story rather than providing a simple cameo fan service and a sendoff that proves family is more than just based on blood \u2013 it's the people that you choose to ride with you no matter where the road takes you and no matter how impossible the odds are and how much destruction there is to your name.\n\nDisclaimer: \nThis is an unofficial fan-made concept trailer made solely for the purpose of entertainment and artistry.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
