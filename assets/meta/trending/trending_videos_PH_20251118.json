(Love love)\nWe give it all we got (Give it all we got)\nYou finally left the table (Uh, uh)\nAnd what a simple thought\nYou're starving 'til you're not\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)\nHave messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)\nLife is a song, it ends when it ends\nYou move on\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's when I told you, \"It's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nSleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\"\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is just\nA storm inside a teacup\nBut shelter here with me, my love\nThunder like a drum\nThis life will beat you up, up, up, up\nThis is just\nA temporary speed bump\nBut failure brings you freedom\nAnd I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you sweat it, baby, it's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nOh, so sleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before (No)\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n.........\n\ud83d\udce7 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n\ud83d\udc8c Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com\n.........\n\ud83d\udcdd Licensing / Sync Requests for 7clouds Releases: licensing@7clouds.org\n.........\n\n#taylorswift #opalite #lyrics #7clouds",

(Love love)\nWe give it all we got (Give it all we got)\nYou finally left the table (Uh, uh)\nAnd what a simple thought\nYou're starving 'til you're not\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)\nHave messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)\nLife is a song, it ends when it ends\nYou move on\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd that's when I told you, \"It's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nSleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\"\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is just\nA storm inside a teacup\nBut shelter here with me, my love\nThunder like a drum\nThis life will beat you up, up, up, up\nThis is just\nA temporary speed bump\nBut failure brings you freedom\nAnd I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you sweat it, baby, it's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nOh, so sleepless in the onyx night\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, my Lord\nNever met no one like you before (No)\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n.........\n\ud83d\udce7 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org\n.........\n\ud83d\udc8c Demos / Music Submissions: https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com\n.........\n\ud83d\udcdd Licensing / Sync Requests for 7clouds Releases: licensing@7clouds.org\n.........\n\n#taylorswift #opalite #lyrics #7clouds"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
