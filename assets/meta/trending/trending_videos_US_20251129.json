You will explore a vast ocean world featuring a deep crafting system with limited resources, allowing you to forge your path and build the tools to save humanity.\n\nThe Earth has been swallowed by the ocean as towering megastructures rust under a yawning sky. The Last Caretaker isn't just about survival, it's about discovery. Your choices shape the narrative, offering a personal and thought-provoking adventure that reaches from the sea to the stars.\n\nThe Last Caretaker is a thoughtful take on the survival-crafting genre, where every decision you make and every action has a consequence. Immerse yourself in a meticulously crafted world where the fate of humanity rests in your hands. Your mission is clear: recover human seeds, reactivate the Lazarus Complex, and launch the last of humanity to the stars.\n\nNURTURE HUMANS\n\nCare for and grow human seeds within the Lazarus Complex, managing crucial systems like incubation temperature, nutrient flow, and memory data integration. Unlock advanced biopods and synthetic caretakers to accelerate development and ensure successful revival. Discover emotional imprints and past memories encoded in each seed, piecing together lost human stories as you bring life back into the world.\n\nPROTECT HUMANS\n\nDefend the Lazarus Complex from rogue machines and environmental threats. Build automated defenses, upgrade your mobile platform, and deploy countermeasures during storms and system breaches. Safeguard the vulnerable human seeds and ensure the sanctuary remains operational while under siege. Strategic choices in protection systems can determine the fate of the last generation of humans.\n\nLAUNCH ROCKETS INTO ORBIT\n\nRestore and reactivate the ancient MOSES launch infrastructure to send reborn humans beyond the drowning world. Scavenge for launch codes, refine fuel, and rebuild navigation AI systems to ensure mission success. Each launch is a calculated risk but a necessary one to preserve the species. Watch your nurtured humans ascend into orbit, carrying with them the hopes of humanity\u2019s future.",
