People were more likely to use complete sentences, avoid contractions in formal settings, and employ a richer vocabulary of polite formulas and courtesies. The pace was slower, with clearer articulation - partly due to the influence of oratory as a major form of entertainment and political engagement. Public speaking skills were highly valued, and this influenced everyday conversation patterns.\nThe Great Divide\nPerhaps most importantly, Americans born in 1835 lived through a period when regional accents were becoming more, not less, distinct.

Their vowel sounds would have been markedly different too - the \"cot-caught\" merger that makes these words sound identical to most modern Americans hadn't yet occurred, and the \"father-bother\" merger was still in progress. Regional variations were already pronounced: New Englanders were beginning to adopt the non-rhotic speech patterns of upper-class Britain, Southerners were developing their distinctive drawl influenced by Scots-Irish settlement patterns, and Western settlers were creating new dialect mixtures. The overall pace of speech was likely slower and more formal than today, with clearer articulation of individual syllables and less of the relaxed, contracted speech we associate with modern American English. Interestingly, an 1835-born American's accent would probably sound more \"British\" to modern ears than contemporary American speech, yet it would also contain distinctly American innovations that were already setting it apart from the mother country - representing a fascinating snapshot of American English in transition during the antebellum period.\n\n#accents #americanaccents #oldschool",
