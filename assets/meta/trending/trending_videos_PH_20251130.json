Equal parts tender and addictive, the song turns desire into a metaphor for sugar, with lines that confess a compulsive need for more. Just like candy, there can be too much of a good thing, especially when you know it\u2019s not good for you. But unlike this song, this guilty-free pleasure will keep you listening over and over again \n\n#BINI_SweetTooth and the #BINI_FLAMES album is now on all platforms: https://orcd.co/bini_flames \n\nBINI is an 8-member girl group composed of young, modern Filipinas who aspire to share their talent & passion w/the world.\n\nIf you like our videos, don't forget to subscribe to our channel - http://bit.ly/BINIPH\n\nConnect, follow, and have a conversation with us on our social media accounts:\nFacebook: https://www.fb.com/biniph.official\nInstagram: instagram.com/bini_ph \nX: x.com/BINI_ph\nTiktok: tiktok.com/@bini_ph \n\nPerformed By: BINI\nChoreographed By: Reden Blanquera & Matthew Almodovar\nComposed By: Kyra Fields, Melanie Joy Fontana, Lindgren, Jurek Reunam\u00e4ki\nProduced By: Lindgren, Jurek Reunam\u00e4ki\n\nABS-CBN Music\nExecutive Producers: Carlo Katigbak, Roxy Liquigan\nHead, Creatives, Content, and Operations: Jonathan Manalo\nHead, International Content: Christopher Lopez\nHead, International Marketing and Promo Partnerships: Naomi Enriquez\nHead, Business Development: Devin Lopez\nHead, Tarsier Records: Marey Garcia\nMarketing and Promotions Specialists: Pio Cruz & Raffie Leon\nMultimedia Producers: Francine Beatrix Amor & Gem A\u00f1onuevo\nOperations Associate: Julia Burce De Guzman \nMarketing and Multimedia Resident: Kyle Francisco\n\nFanatical Marketing\nExecutive Producers: David Boxenbaum and Adam Zelinka\n\nABS\u2013CBN CORPORATION\nHead of Entertainment Production and Star Magic: Laurenti Dyogi\nHead Talent Manager: Mylene Mallari\nTalent Manager: Ronald Faina\nAssociate Producer: Anthony Lester Fial\nPerformance Director: Mickey Perz\nDance Coaches: Reden Blanquera & Matthew Almodovar\nVoice Coach: Marianna Graham\nRoad Manager: Marianne Manauis-Nieva\nMMP & Social Media Manager: Nelson Ocampo Jr.\nMMPs: Renee Angeles & Maeryll Quijada\n\nABS-CBN Music Publishing and Digital Content\nHead, Business Development, Distribution & Publishing: Atty.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Unlike traditional games, Roblox is built almost entirely by its community \u2014 players design and share the games, worlds, and experiences that others can enjoy.\nAlthough it\u2019s especially popular among teens (ages 13\u201318), Roblox is open to players of all ages. Everyone begins by creating a unique avatar and then can explore countless worlds, chat with others, play games, or even team up to build new projects.\n\n#Roblox #99nightintheforest #99nights",

Unlike traditional games, Roblox is built almost entirely by its community \u2014 players design and share the games, worlds, and experiences that others can enjoy.\nAlthough it\u2019s especially popular among teens (ages 13\u201318), Roblox is open to players of all ages. Everyone begins by creating a unique avatar and then can explore countless worlds, chat with others, play games, or even team up to build new projects.\n\n#Roblox #99nightintheforest #99nights"
