Get tickets now.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, Blumhouse\u2019s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town\u2019s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike\u2019s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy\u2019s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy\u2019s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                    "description": "Where do I even begin? The day was Oct. 2nd, the force wipe that would change Rust... forever. A new progression system was implemented into the game which presented new but exciting challenges. To make matters even more interesting, this was the wipe where I played with three of my own subscribers. GeekMartyr, Tairyr, and @LuTon1c . This story had such an interesting turn of events. From an unexpected rivalry with a familiar face, to the craziest online raids/raid defenses... this quickly became My Best Force Wipe.\n\nJoin the Blooprint x Ironside PC Giveaway! https://gleam.io/Cybl3/blooprint-x-ironside-3000-pc-giveaway\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Channels:\nBlooprint's Bunker - https://www.youtube.com/@BlooprintsBunker\nBlooprint's Vault - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClMuosUutVxH7hTGVyUzppA?sub_confirmation=1\nTwitch - https://www.twitch.tv/blooprint\nKick - https://kick.com/blooprint\nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@blooprintgames\n\nMy Socials:\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/blooprintgames\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/blooprint\nMerch - https://www.blooprintgaming.com/\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Rust servers:\nBloo Lagoon Discord - https://lagoonrust.com/discord\nBloo Lagoon Website - https://lagoonrust.com/\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPC Specs:\nProcessor - Ryzen 9 7950x3D\nGraphics Card - ASUS TUF RTX 4080\nMemory - G.SKILL Trident Z5 64GB DDR5 6000\nMotherboard - ASUS TUF B650-PLUS WIFI\nCPU Cooler - Noctua NH-D15\nPower Supply - 1000 GT 80 Plus Gold 1000W Fully Modular\nSSD - 4TB Crucial P3 Plus M.2\nHard Drive - 4TB HDD\nCase - Lian Li Lancool 216RX Black Steel\nPCPartPicker - https://pcpartpicker.com/list/FHT7PJ\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEquipment:\nHeadphones - SENNHEISER HD 660 S\nMouse - Custom Themed Lamzu Atlantis\nKeyboard - KBD75v3 Custom Keyboard w/ JWK Poseidon lubed switches, Brass Plate & Doubleshot Keycaps\nMic - Rode Procaster\nMonitor (main) - Samsung Odyssey G7 240Hz (2560x1440)\nMonitor (secondary) - Samsung Odyssey G5 144Hz (2560x1440) [x2]\nCapture Card - Elgato 4K60 Pro MK.2\nStream Deck - Elgato Mini\nSound Mixer - TC Helicon GoXLR \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChannel Art/Design:\nEdited by - Iced (https://www.youtube.com/@Icedddddd)\nThumbnail - Veysel Kara (https://twitter.com/veys_el_kara) \nMascot Design and Twitch Graphics - Rotting Jackal (https://www.rottingjackal.com/)\nBanner & Illustrated Thumbnails - Veysel Kara (https://twitter.com/veys_el_kara)\nOG Logo Design - Curzurer (https://curzurer.carbonmade.com/)\nIntro, Outro & Motion Design - Bryan G.

What\u2019s left to give?\nWhen everything\u2019s broken\nChasing the wind\nUnder those scars, there\u2019s a lion within\nStay in the moment\nAnd history lasts because you wrote it\n\nMake your whole life worth the Sacrifice\nEvery scream you cry worth the blood you\u2019ve given\nTo bathe in the floodlights, would you Sacrifice it all?\n(Oh, it all)\n\u2018Til they know your name\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n\nFabled the ground below your feet\nThe heroes you worship\nAnd legends you read\nThere\u2019s only one step below eternity\nAnd history lasts because you walked it\n\nMake your whole life worth the Sacrifice\nEvery scream they cry worth the blood you\u2019ve given\nTo bathe in the floodlights, would you Sacrifice it all?\n(Oh, it all)\n\u2018Til they know your name\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh) Would you Sacrifice It All?\n(Oh, it all)\n\u2018Til they know your name\n\nTags:\n#leagueoflegends #sacrifice #lyrics"
