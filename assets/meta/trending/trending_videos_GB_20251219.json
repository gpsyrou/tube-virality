ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."

Usually beating maps under an ARK challenge. Unlocking the ending cinematics is easy with no cheats needed anymore, and usually on a server, official or unofficial, I'm not fussed. Single Player is great though, certainly with a guide for any platform be it xbox, ps4, ps5, pc, it's great. Sometimes play some wild mods, and usually post patch/update. But a survival game needs some community news and that's what I do, giving you the latest on events, maps, maybe even premium mods and official usually covering all maps from Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration to Extinction, Gen 1 & Genesis Part 2.  And one day. ARK 2!\n\n#playark #arksurvivalascended #ark2",

Usually beating maps under an ARK challenge. Unlocking the ending cinematics is easy with no cheats needed anymore, and usually on a server, official or unofficial, I'm not fussed. Single Player is great though, certainly with a guide for any platform be it xbox, ps4, ps5, pc, it's great. Sometimes play some wild mods, and usually post patch/update. But a survival game needs some community news and that's what I do, giving you the latest on events, maps, maybe even premium mods and official usually covering all maps from Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration to Extinction, Gen 1 & Genesis Part 2.  And one day. ARK 2!\n\n#playark #arksurvivalascended #ark2"

                "description": "No Touch is colourful and steeped in heavy realism, a kitchen sink drama. It\u2019s a song about isolation, loneliness, and crushing self-harm, and the ways we try to navigate these feelings under the rigid structures of conformity. The song explores the murkier edges of drug use and the exhibitionism that can accompany it and Andrea Arnold was a perfect match for its soft-nightmare atmosphere. It couldn\u2019t have been captured by anyone else. She took us back to her old neighbourhood, which felt strangely familiar to me. Like her films, the video doesn\u2019t fade to complete darkness, it trails a thread of hope too.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
