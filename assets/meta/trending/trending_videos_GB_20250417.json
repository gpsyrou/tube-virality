                "description": "This is the first confirmed live observation of the colossal squid, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, at depth in its natural habitat. Pilots filmed the young 30-centimeter-long (one-foot) cephalopod at about 600m near the South Sandwich Islands as the Schmidt Ocean Institute\u2019s remotely operated vehicle SuBastian descended through the water column on a dive aiming to discover new marine species, in partnership with Ocean Census during the #SouthSandwichIslands expedition.\n\nMesonychoteuthis hamiltoni was formally described and named 100 years ago, in 1925, based on two partial specimens found in the stomach of a sperm whale near the South Shetland Islands. However, no one has ever captured footage of a living colossal squid until now.\n\nSeabirds, marine mammals, and fishes prey on juvenile colossal squid. At full size, their only known predators are sperm whales and sleeper sharks, although remains of large adults have also been found in toothfish stomachs, likely scavenged. Experts believe colossal squid may reach total lengths of 6 to 7 meters and weigh about as much as a small Italian Fiat at more than 500 kilograms, making them the heaviest known invertebrate.\nDr Kat Bolstad, associate professor and lab leader of the Auckland University of Technology Lab, NZ, worked with glass squid expert Dr. Aaron Evans to help confirm this observation, and she narrated this video.\n\nwww.schmidtoceaninstitute.org\nwww.oceancensus.org \nAssociate Professor Dr Kat Bolstad, lab leader of the AUT Lab for Cephalopod Ecology & Systematics\n\n_________\n\nWe livestream our ROV dives on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch!\n\nJoin us on our oceanographic missions on our other social media platforms:\nYouTube:    / schmidtocean   \nFacebook:    / events  \nTwitch:   / schmidtocean  \nTwitter:   / schmidtocean   \nInstagram:   / schmidtocean  \n\nLive data feeds from R/V Falkor (too):\n\ud83d\udea2 Where's Falkor (too)? https://soi-vessel-tracker.web.app/\n\ud83c\udf26\ufe0f How's the weather? https://www.windy.com/station/ship-zgoj7\n\nSign up for our newsletter here: \nNewsletter link: https://mailchi.mp/schmidtocean.org/s...   \n\n_________\n\nSchmidt Ocean Institute is a 501(c)(3) private non-profit operating foundation established to advance oceanographic research, discovery, and knowledge, and catalyze sharing of information about the oceans.",
