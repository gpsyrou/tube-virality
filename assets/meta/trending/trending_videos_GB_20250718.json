Bottomless black soil, brutal climbs, and tracks that have completely vanished. This one\u2019s going to push us, and the rigs, to the absolute limit. \ud83d\ude33\n\nWe\u2019ve got the convoy to take it on\u2026 and we\u2019re not just doing it for the challenge.

                    "description": "I review, breakdown and explain Stranger Things Season 5 Trailer. I give my reaction to the new official teaser for the final season. I discuss the new clips in the preview which showed Vecna returning and looking different, Jonathan potentially dying in the upside down, Will being connected to The Mind Flayer and being taken by Vecna, Eddie's grave being defaced, the return of the Demodogs, the portal in Hawkins Library to the upside down and the final battle with Vecna and Eleven. I give my theories and predictions on what could happen to Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Nancy, Robin, the new characters, The Mind Flayer, Hopper, Joyce, Robin, the ending and the release date. \n\n00:00 Intro\n00:14 Stranger Things Season 5 Trailer Breakdown\n08:38 Outro\n\nSubscribe for more videos like this! \nFOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nhttps://letterboxd.com/BrainPilot/\nhttps://twitter.com/BrainPilot_\n\nIf you enjoyed the video make sure to give it a like and comment.
