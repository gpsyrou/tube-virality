People were more likely to use complete sentences, avoid contractions in formal settings, and employ a richer vocabulary of polite formulas and courtesies. The pace was slower, with clearer articulation - partly due to the influence of oratory as a major form of entertainment and political engagement. Public speaking skills were highly valued, and this influenced everyday conversation patterns.\nThe Great Divide\nPerhaps most importantly, Americans born in 1835 lived through a period when regional accents were becoming more, not less, distinct. Unlike today's trend toward dialect leveling due to mass media, the mid-19th century saw increasing regional isolation that allowed local speech patterns to intensify. A Georgian plantation owner, a Vermont.\n\nThis generation's speech was heavily influenced by the Second Great Awakening, which spread particular religious vocabularies and speaking styles across regions. The rise of public education was beginning to standardize certain pronunciations, while the explosion of newspapers and pamphlets created shared written standards that influenced spoken norms. Immigration from Ireland and Germany was introducing new sounds and speech patterns, particularly in growing cities.\n\n\nMost notably, they would have pronounced their R's much more consistently than many Americans today, as the \"dropping\" of R sounds (non-rhoticity) that characterizes modern Boston, New York, and Southern accents was just beginning to spread from prestigious East Coast cities. Their vowel sounds would have been markedly different too - the \"cot-caught\" merger that makes these words sound identical to most modern Americans hadn't yet occurred, and the \"father-bother\" merger was still in progress. Regional variations were already pronounced: New Englanders were beginning to adopt the non-rhotic speech patterns of upper-class Britain, Southerners were developing their distinctive drawl influenced by Scots-Irish settlement patterns, and Western settlers were creating new dialect mixtures. The overall pace of speech was likely slower and more formal than today, with clearer articulation of individual syllables and less of the relaxed, contracted speech we associate with modern American English. Interestingly, an 1835-born American's accent would probably sound more \"British\" to modern ears than contemporary American speech, yet it would also contain distinctly American innovations that were already setting it apart from the mother country - representing a fascinating snapshot of American English in transition during the antebellum period.\n\n#accents #americanaccents #oldschool",
