It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

SO this one was a little tricky for me, of all the characters I\u2019ve turned into a Villain Luisa was a hard one because she\u2019s just so dang lovely and wonderful and wouldn\u2019t want to hurt a fly! So to me it made sense to give her more of a Jekyl and Hyde story - a more introspective fight between the good and bad within her!! Naturally with a big ole rock song \n\nAlso if you didn\u2019t know (I\u2019d be impressed if you didn\u2019t because lord knows I\u2019ve been talking about it non stop) IM DROPPING AN ALBUM ON OCTOBER 11th - Pre-save here https://ffm.to/thewoodsdebutalbum.OYD\n\nIf you wish to support me and my lovely cat Fig mark down Oct 11th and give my album a spin when it releases (listen the whole eay through for extra brownie points) \nAnd If you really REALLY want to help support us then listen to it and add your fave songs to your playlists / save to your spotify library! It lets the Spotify Gods know that it\u2019s not awful music \u270c\ufe0f HELP FIG BECOME A CHEF\n\nNow for LUISA\u2019S VILLAIN STORY\n\nLuisa has carried the burden of care for her family and community ever since her powers manifested. Constantly called on to support those around her and expected to never falter. But the pressure of constant demands and high expectations is something no one can handle for long. At one point you have to take hold of your future and decide, will I continue to allow those that claim they love me to take advantage of me? Or will I tear it all down? Luisa cares deeply about her family and community and now must make a decision, does she stay good and sacrifice her own needs for those around her or does she give into her dark side and rip apart all they forced her to build? And will that identity crisis destroy her?\n\nLYRICS\n\nCarry the weight you are handed\nFollow the path they demanded\nOnly you hold us together\nHold together\nHold together\n\nBut what if I let it break down\nLet the pressure build up, break the bough\nIf I stopped looking in and look out\nBetter lookout\nBetter lookout\n\nI\u2019ll tear down all you built up\nThis weight is yours to lift love\n\nI am a God I am chosen\nGave you this world and now I\u2019ll see it broken\nI hear the pleas from the churchless\nWreckages wrought in my name you deserve this\nYou\u2019re crying help but it\u2019s needless\nElevate me like a priestess\nNow your life is fading\nHold onto that last shred hope and pray heaven is waiting\n\nSo I\u2019ll tear it down\nWalk and break the ground\nDestroy the very thing that watches as I drown\nThrew me around but I rebound\nRegretting the way that you spoke now\nGet ready\nI\u2019m coming\nTo tear it down\n\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nI\u2019ll tear it tear it down\n\nShoulders are free of the baggage\nyou\u2019re no longer taking advantage\nToo scared to speak up to the savage\nI\u2019m a savage\nI can manage\n\nMy worth it is based on my own heart\nNot based on the pressure you impart\nwhat if the bruises are my mark\nI\u2019m an upstart\nCan we restart\n\nUseless, I am what\u2019s broken\nDon\u2019t want your trust and I don\u2019t want devotion\nOnce I would save, now I\u2019m worthless\nWorry is wrought on my face I can\u2019t swerve this\n\nYou want a me that is long gone\nAll there is now is a swan-song\nMy breath is failing and now it\u2019s just\npain and destruction that I am exhaling\n\nSo I\u2019ll tear it down\nWalk and break the ground\nDestroy the very thing that watches as I drown\nThrew me around but I rebound\nRegretting the way that you spoke now\nGet ready\nI\u2019m coming\nTo tear it down\n\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nI\u2019ll tear it tear it down\n\nThis isn\u2019t what I wanted\nThis isn\u2019t what I wanted\nThis isn\u2019t what I wanted\nThis isn\u2019t what I\nAh!\nAh!\n\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nPlease take me down\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nPlease take me down\nI\u2019ll tear it down\nPlease take me down\nI\u2019ll tear it down\n\n\u2728CREDITS\u2728\n\nVocals / Lyrics - Lydia the Bard \n\nMusic - \u202a@tonyhalliwellmusic https://www.tony-halliwell-music.com/\n\nAnimatic - \u202aLucile Dufau @thereinalulu  https://www.instagram.com/thereinalulu?igsh=NHVwdDRpYmhhMzl0\n\nEnding ad\nInstrumental - Ben Tomalin \nAnimatic - Zobeebop - https://www.instagram.com/zobeebop?igsh=MWVxZ3RsaDN2enBjaA==\n\n#Luisavillainsong #villain #villainsong #encanto #disney",
