Warner's official cause of death was asphyxia, police said.\n\nIn an interview with 6abc, Bill Cosby, who is a native of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, spoke about Jamal Warner's death.\n\n\"You could depend on Malcolm always going to uh the shelter, to learn his lines, to gather his character to come out and be ready. When the news came, it was shocking. And of course, my thoughts went straight to his mother, who worked so hard. She was so wonderful with him,\" Cosby told 6abc anchor Sharrie Williams.\n#billcosby #news #fyp #fypage",

Warner's official cause of death was asphyxia, police said.\n\nIn an interview with 6abc, Bill Cosby, who is a native of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, spoke about Jamal Warner's death.\n\n\"You could depend on Malcolm always going to uh the shelter, to learn his lines, to gather his character to come out and be ready. When the news came, it was shocking. And of course, my thoughts went straight to his mother, who worked so hard. She was so wonderful with him,\" Cosby told 6abc anchor Sharrie Williams.\n#billcosby #news #fyp #fypage"
