                "description": "The epic conclusion comes to theaters this November. Watch the #WickedForGood trailer now  \ud83e\uddf9\ud83e\udee7\n\nPre-save \u2018Wicked: For Good \u2013 The Soundtrack\u2019 at https://wickedthesoundtrack.com\n-----\nTikTok: tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook: FACEBOOK.com/wickedmovie \nX: x.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram: instagram.com/wickedmovie\nOfficial Site: www.wickedmovie.com\n\nAnd now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend \u2026\n\nLast year\u2019s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. \n\nDirected once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award\u00ae nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz\u2019s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar\u00ae winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda\u2019s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba\u2019s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars\u00ae for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar\u00ae winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                "description": "The 2025 NBA Finals are here\u2014and it\u2019s a basketball purist\u2019s dream. On this NBA Finals Preview Episode, LeBron James and Steve Nash break down why this Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers series might be the most compelling Finals matchup in years.\n\nLeBron gives insight to Tyrese Haliburton's mindset from their time together on Team USA at the Paris Olympics, and Steve praises his offensive initiation and passing. The conversation dives into how Hali\u2019s pace, vision, and unpredictability fuel Indiana\u2019s offense\u2014and how T.J. McConnell and Myles Turner complement Rick Carlisle's organized chaos.\n\nThe duo also dissect the Thunder's \"swarm\" mindset on defense, what sets their personnel apart from other teams, and how Alex Caruso is the perfect example of how they operate. \n\nFrom the Pacers\u2019 randomness to OKC\u2019s defensive identity, LeBron and Nash explore every angle of this stylistic clash. Does good offense beat good defense? Who will win the possession game? And what makes this Finals not just exciting\u2014but evolutionary?\n\nPresented by UNINTERRUPTED and Wondery.\n\n(0:00) - Intro\n(1:17) - LeBron's experience with Haliburton on Team USA during the 2024 Paris Olympics\n(4:01) - Haliburton's confidence and trash talking\n(5:15) - How the Pacers are ignited by Haliburton's throw ahead passes\n(14:01) - T.J.

                    "description": "The 2025 NBA Finals are here\u2014and it\u2019s a basketball purist\u2019s dream. On this NBA Finals Preview Episode, LeBron James and Steve Nash break down why this Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers series might be the most compelling Finals matchup in years.\n\nLeBron gives insight to Tyrese Haliburton's mindset from their time together on Team USA at the Paris Olympics, and Steve praises his offensive initiation and passing. The conversation dives into how Hali\u2019s pace, vision, and unpredictability fuel Indiana\u2019s offense\u2014and how T.J. McConnell and Myles Turner complement Rick Carlisle's organized chaos.\n\nThe duo also dissect the Thunder's \"swarm\" mindset on defense, what sets their personnel apart from other teams, and how Alex Caruso is the perfect example of how they operate. \n\nFrom the Pacers\u2019 randomness to OKC\u2019s defensive identity, LeBron and Nash explore every angle of this stylistic clash. Does good offense beat good defense? Who will win the possession game? And what makes this Finals not just exciting\u2014but evolutionary?\n\nPresented by UNINTERRUPTED and Wondery.\n\n(0:00) - Intro\n(1:17) - LeBron's experience with Haliburton on Team USA during the 2024 Paris Olympics\n(4:01) - Haliburton's confidence and trash talking\n(5:15) - How the Pacers are ignited by Haliburton's throw ahead passes\n(14:01) - T.J.

The girls were found after a search of the area, but Decker was nowhere to be found.\n\nDecker is wanted for three counts of first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping in connection with the girls' deaths. The sheriff\u2019s office said Decker is \u201cformer military with extensive training.\u201d The reward for any information that leads to Decker's capture is now up to $20,000.\n\nIt is currently unknown if Decker is armed, but authorities said he should be considered armed and dangerous. Authorities described Decker as white, around 5 feet, 8 inches tall, 190 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a light-colored shirt and dark shorts.\n\nAnyone with information about Decker\u2019s location is asked to call 911 or send a tip to the CCSO online.\n\nSTORY: https://komonews.com/news/local/manhunt-court-documents-3-wenatchee-sisters-chelan-county-travis-decker-35-years-old-20000-dollar-reward-olivia-evelun-paityn-rock-island-campground \n______________\nStay up to date with our social media:\n\nKOMO News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KOMONews/\nKOMO News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/komonews\nKOMO News on Instagram: http://instagram.com/komo4\nKOMO News on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@komo4seattle\n\nSubscribe to KOMO on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC__2_0RJ8XnHt2angfw6S1Q/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch more top local news stories: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G97AyNO_3IE&list=PLZm7uq7_dyY6qhFFIwgXRvYpkaOnZEabc&index=2&t=0s\n\nFor all of the day\u2019s top local and national news, visit http://www.komonews.com/\nWatch our live newscasts and other live video at https://komonews.com/watch\n\nDownload our iOS App: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/komo-news-mobile/id433508161?mt=8 \n\nDownload our Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newssynergy.komo&hl=en \n\nHave a news tip?
