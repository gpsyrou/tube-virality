Or will a liar get away with -- wait, actually... what's going on with this polygraph machine? It seems to be some sort of vessel for universal truths.  It holds the answers to every question. Hold that thought about the criminal stuff. Time to ask about teleportation, the meaning of life, and lotto numbers. \n\nOuttakes, deleted scenes, director commentary and so much more up on our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/chrisandjack\n\nWatch our most popular sketches! https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSpZLcBI3iW8UuwB6O3FwEYh6XxfvC1By&si=SEhfz3BDucMkV17J&playnext=1  \n\nWe're Chris W. Smith and Jack De Sena (aka Chris & Jack). We've been friends for years and love making high-quality, high-concept sketch comedy. Chris is an occasional Blue Man in Blue Man Group. As a voice actor, Jack played Sokka in Avatar the Last Airbender and Callum in the Dragon Prince. In 2016 we united to create this channel, confusingly titled \u201cChris & Jack\u201d, which has served as a shared platform to write, produce, direct, edit, and star in our own stuff. We're releasing comedic sketches of all shapes and sizes. Sci-Fi, Heists, animation, movie tropes, fantasy, absurdist bits, and plenty of fun new experiments. But above all else, friendship.  \n\nA huge thank you to all our Patrons, including our \"Producer Tier\" friends:\nDJ Smu-Mu\nSteve Mould\n\nWe love you!\n\nCheck out all our stuff: https://chrisandjack.komi.io/\n-Merchandise: https://www.pixelempire.com/collections/chris-and-jack\n-Our podcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjHQDpOQYcsbahkI2yAmxjw\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisandjacksketch (Chris) https://www.instagram.com/chrissmithwho (Jack) https://www.instagram.com/jackdesena\n-Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisandjackarechrisandjack\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/chris_and_jack\n-Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisAndJack/\n-Discord: https://discord.gg/sBVGdmg  \n\nCAST:\n\nDetective - Chris W.

                    "description": "A detective grills a suspect. Will this interrogation lead to a huge confession? Or will a liar get away with -- wait, actually... what's going on with this polygraph machine? It seems to be some sort of vessel for universal truths.  It holds the answers to every question. Hold that thought about the criminal stuff. Time to ask about teleportation, the meaning of life, and lotto numbers. \n\nOuttakes, deleted scenes, director commentary and so much more up on our Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/chrisandjack\n\nWatch our most popular sketches! https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSpZLcBI3iW8UuwB6O3FwEYh6XxfvC1By&si=SEhfz3BDucMkV17J&playnext=1  \n\nWe're Chris W. Smith and Jack De Sena (aka Chris & Jack). We've been friends for years and love making high-quality, high-concept sketch comedy. Chris is an occasional Blue Man in Blue Man Group. As a voice actor, Jack played Sokka in Avatar the Last Airbender and Callum in the Dragon Prince. In 2016 we united to create this channel, confusingly titled \u201cChris & Jack\u201d, which has served as a shared platform to write, produce, direct, edit, and star in our own stuff. We're releasing comedic sketches of all shapes and sizes. Sci-Fi, Heists, animation, movie tropes, fantasy, absurdist bits, and plenty of fun new experiments. But above all else, friendship.  \n\nA huge thank you to all our Patrons, including our \"Producer Tier\" friends:\nDJ Smu-Mu\nSteve Mould\n\nWe love you!\n\nCheck out all our stuff: https://chrisandjack.komi.io/\n-Merchandise: https://www.pixelempire.com/collections/chris-and-jack\n-Our podcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjHQDpOQYcsbahkI2yAmxjw\n-Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/chrisandjacksketch (Chris) https://www.instagram.com/chrissmithwho (Jack) https://www.instagram.com/jackdesena\n-Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/chrisandjackarechrisandjack\n-Twitter: https://twitter.com/chris_and_jack\n-Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisAndJack/\n-Discord: https://discord.gg/sBVGdmg  \n\nCAST:\n\nDetective - Chris W.

I\u2019ve lost challenges from him before, and this could be the last chance I have to finally win back my PSA 10 Shiny Charizard GX from Hidden Fates. Do you think I can do it?\n\nAlso, HUGE shout out to TCG Stadium, the sponsor of this video. I've purchased cards from TCG Stadium, so I recommend them as trustworthy.
