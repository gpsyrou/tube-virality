ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

Get tickets now.\n\n---\n\nIn 2023, Blumhouse\u2019s box-office horror phenomenon Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s, based on the blockbuster game series by Scott Cawthon, became the highest-grossing horror film of the year. Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town\u2019s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike\u2019s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy\u2019s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy\u2019s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

Are you climbing up the walls?\nAre you deafened by the headlines? Or does your head not hear at all? Are you pacified by passion?\nAre you armed to the teeth?\nAre you bubbling at the surface, of what\u2019s cooking underneath?\nAre you dying for an answer?\nFrom what they call good grief?\nBut there\u2019s a terrific chance there\u2019s nothing, beyond what you believe\n\nOh don\u2019t you say that you think I\u2019m in glory\nOh don\u2019t you say that you think I\u2019m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\nI went to the liquor store and they took all my money\nI stared into the mirror there and begged a man to love me\nDo you love your blessed father? Anoint by fear of death\nDo you feel the lies creep on by? As soft as baby\u2019s breath\nDo you beg that truth will set you free? Are you shackled by the keys?\nWell if I was you, I\u2019d stay strapped in, cos\u2019 all you\u2019ve got is me.\n\nOh don\u2019t you say that you think I\u2019m in glory\nOh don\u2019t you say that you think I\u2019m going to get no glory\nRunning to the exit with a huge grin on my face \nScreaming hope is behind and I wanna get high\n\n#themountain #gorillaz #newmusic #kong",
