ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Nate Ruess\"\n\n[Intro]\nInhale harder\nWanna feel your heartbeat louder\n\n[Verse 1: P!nk]\nRight from the start\nYou were a thief, you stole my heart\nAnd I your willing victim\nI let you see the parts of me\nThat weren't all that pretty\nAnd with every touch you fixed them\n\nNow you've been talking in your sleep\nOh, oh\nThings you never say to me\nOh, oh\nTell me that you've had enough\nOf our love, our love\n\n[Chorus: P!nk]\nJust give me a reason\nJust a little bit's enough\nJust a second - we're not broken, just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\nIt's in the stars\nIt's been written in the scars on our hearts\nWe're not broken, just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\n\n[Verse 2: Nate Ruess & P!nk & both]\nI'm sorry I don't understand\nWhere all of this is coming from\nI thought that we were fine\n(Oh we had everything)\nYour head is running wild again\nMy dear, we still have everything\nAnd it's all in your mind\n(Yeah but this is happening)\n\nYou've been having real bad dreams\nOh, oh\nYou used to lie so close to me\nOh, oh\nThere's nothing more than empty sheets\nBetween our love, our love\nOh, our love, our love, love\n\n[Chorus: Nate Ruess & both]\nJust give me a reason\nJust a little bit\u2019s enough\nJust a second - we\u2019re not broken, just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\nI\u2019ve never stopped\nYou\u2019re still written in the scars on my heart\nYou\u2019re not broken, just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\n\n[Bridge: Nate Ruess & P!nk]\nOh, tears ducts and rust\nI'll fix it for us\nWe're collecting dust but our love's enough\nYou're holding it in\nYou're pouring a drink\nNo, nothing is as bad as it seems\nWe'll come clean\n\n[Chorus: Both]\nJust give me a reason\nJust a little bit's enough\nJust a second we're not broken just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\nIt's in the stars\nIt's been written in the scars on our hearts\nThat we're not broken just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\n\n[Chorus: Both]\nJust give me a reason\nJust a little bit's enough\nJust a second we're not broken just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\nIt's in the stars\nIt's still written in the scars on our hearts\nThat we're not broken just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\n\n[Outro: P!nk]\nOh, we can learn to love again\nOh, can learn to love again\nOh\nThat we're not broken just bent\nAnd we can learn to love again\n\n\u00d7=\u00d7=\u00d7=\u00d7=\u00d7\n\n\ud83c\udff7\ufe0fTags\n#pink #nateruess #justgivemeareason #dailyhiphop \n\ud83d\udce5 Submit your music: https://orbitalmusic.portal.district.biz/app/login\n\n\ud83d\udccc LINKS: \nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/@OrbitalMusix?sub_confirmation=1\n\nP!nk Just Give Me a Reason lyrics\nJust Give Me a Reason P!nk Nate Ruess lyrics\nP!nk Nate Ruess lyrics\nJust Give Me a Reason official lyrics\nP!nk love song lyrics\nNate Ruess duet lyrics\nPop ballad lyrics\nP!nk 2012 hit lyrics\nJust Give Me a Reason live lyrics\nP!nk music lyrics"
