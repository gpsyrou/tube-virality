Soundwave is also a functional Bluetooth speaker while in cassette mode, with the ability to stream music, with skip through, pause, and play all with Soundwave's front facing retro tape deck buttons. There is also an integrated recording feature. The original G1 voice of Soundwave, Frank Welker, returns with over 200+ recorded lines for Robosen's Soundwave. Robosen's Soundwave also includes articulating hip-joints, 84 high-performance chipsets and 28 precision-built servo motors. \n\nRobosen\u2019s Flagship Soundwave, the second Decepticon collectible within the range, is now available for pre-order at Robosen.com and will soon be available on HasbroPulse.com, and will retail on pre-sale for $999 USD for a 30-day window before moving to its standard price of $1,399.",
