Thomas and James are excited to bring together 5 options for potential buyers and discuss their favourites. From the ultra-lightweight carbon fibre infused Alfa Romeo 4C, to the highly depreciated and highly raucous Jaguar F-Type R, choices abound in this price bracket. Perhaps a concept-car come to life like the BMW i8 is your flavour? Or if it\u2019s displacement you\u2019re after, the C7 Corvette offers plenty. And if you bend your wallet just a bit more over $50k, perhaps a Voodoo engined Mustang GT350 would suit your needs - and your ears. Which would you choose? We hope you enjoy the episode.

Thomas and James are excited to bring together 5 options for potential buyers and discuss their favourites. From the ultra-lightweight carbon fibre infused Alfa Romeo 4C, to the highly depreciated and highly raucous Jaguar F-Type R, choices abound in this price bracket. Perhaps a concept-car come to life like the BMW i8 is your flavour? Or if it\u2019s displacement you\u2019re after, the C7 Corvette offers plenty. And if you bend your wallet just a bit more over $50k, perhaps a Voodoo engined Mustang GT350 would suit your needs - and your ears. Which would you choose? We hope you enjoy the episode.
