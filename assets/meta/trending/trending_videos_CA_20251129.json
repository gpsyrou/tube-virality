Unlock advanced biopods and synthetic caretakers to accelerate development and ensure successful revival. Discover emotional imprints and past memories encoded in each seed, piecing together lost human stories as you bring life back into the world.\n\nPROTECT HUMANS\n\nDefend the Lazarus Complex from rogue machines and environmental threats. Build automated defenses, upgrade your mobile platform, and deploy countermeasures during storms and system breaches. Safeguard the vulnerable human seeds and ensure the sanctuary remains operational while under siege. Strategic choices in protection systems can determine the fate of the last generation of humans.\n\nLAUNCH ROCKETS INTO ORBIT\n\nRestore and reactivate the ancient MOSES launch infrastructure to send reborn humans beyond the drowning world.
