In May 2022 as part of a complex RICO case, Georgia prosecutors alleged that Young Thug\u2014in addition to being the head of a record label, YSL\u2014was also the leader of a gang of the same name. What followed was the longest criminal trial in Georgia history. \r\n\r\nSince getting out, Young Thug has mostly laid low, to the point of sometimes wearing a mask in public. He has not said much about the last few years of his life, or about anything at all, really\u2026 until now. This is the _GQ_ Video Covery Story with Young Thug.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDirector: Cole Evelev\r\nDirector of Photography: Carter Ross\r\nEditor: Robby Massey\r\nTalent: Young Thug; Zach Baron\r\nProducer: Sam Dennis\r\nLine Producer: Jen Santos\r\nProduction Manager: James Pipitone\r\nProduction Coordinator: Elizabeth Hymes\r\nTalent Booker: Tracy Shaffer\r\nSteadicam Operator: Greg Gustafson\r\nCamera Operator: Jon Corum; Taylor Frontier\r\n1st Assistant Camera: Adam Lee\r\n2nd Assistant Camera: Jacob Mariani\r\nGaffer: Noah Spiece\r\nKey Grip: Jack Motter\r\nSwing: Kevin Shum\r\nDIT: Lauren Worona\r\nSound Mixer: Justin Fox\r\nProduction Assistant: Spencer Mathesen; Lily Starck\r\nMake-up Artist: Hee Soo Kwon\r\nHairstylist: Christy Ivory\r\nProduction Designer: Cedar Jocks\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Jess Dunn\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Rachel Kim\r\nSupervising Editor: Rob Lombardi\r\nAssistant Editor: Fynn Lithgow\n\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to GQ on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/2iij5wt\r\nSubscribe to GQ magazine and get rare swag: https://bit.ly/2xNBH3i\r\nJoin the GQ Discord to talk men's fashion, watches, and more: https://discord.gg/gqmagazine\r\n\r\nABOUT GQ\r\nFor more than 50 years, GQ has been the premier men\u2019s magazine, providing definitive coverage of style, culture, politics and more.

                    "description": "\u201cI love people so much to the point that, the only thing that will make me not love you anymore is betrayal,\u201d says Young Thug as he towers over _GQ\u2019s_ Zach Baron in a perfectly landscaped garden, which sits next to an eccentric taxidermy-filled mansion on the East Side of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nIn October of last year, the rapper Young Thug walked free from the Fulton County jail in Atlanta, concluding one of the strangest and most fraught spectacles in modern music. In May 2022 as part of a complex RICO case, Georgia prosecutors alleged that Young Thug\u2014in addition to being the head of a record label, YSL\u2014was also the leader of a gang of the same name. What followed was the longest criminal trial in Georgia history. \r\n\r\nSince getting out, Young Thug has mostly laid low, to the point of sometimes wearing a mask in public. He has not said much about the last few years of his life, or about anything at all, really\u2026 until now. This is the _GQ_ Video Covery Story with Young Thug.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nDirector: Cole Evelev\r\nDirector of Photography: Carter Ross\r\nEditor: Robby Massey\r\nTalent: Young Thug; Zach Baron\r\nProducer: Sam Dennis\r\nLine Producer: Jen Santos\r\nProduction Manager: James Pipitone\r\nProduction Coordinator: Elizabeth Hymes\r\nTalent Booker: Tracy Shaffer\r\nSteadicam Operator: Greg Gustafson\r\nCamera Operator: Jon Corum; Taylor Frontier\r\n1st Assistant Camera: Adam Lee\r\n2nd Assistant Camera: Jacob Mariani\r\nGaffer: Noah Spiece\r\nKey Grip: Jack Motter\r\nSwing: Kevin Shum\r\nDIT: Lauren Worona\r\nSound Mixer: Justin Fox\r\nProduction Assistant: Spencer Mathesen; Lily Starck\r\nMake-up Artist: Hee Soo Kwon\r\nHairstylist: Christy Ivory\r\nProduction Designer: Cedar Jocks\r\nPost Production Supervisor: Jess Dunn\r\nPost Production Coordinator: Rachel Kim\r\nSupervising Editor: Rob Lombardi\r\nAssistant Editor: Fynn Lithgow\n\nStill haven\u2019t subscribed to GQ on YouTube? \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/2iij5wt\r\nSubscribe to GQ magazine and get rare swag: https://bit.ly/2xNBH3i\r\nJoin the GQ Discord to talk men's fashion, watches, and more: https://discord.gg/gqmagazine\r\n\r\nABOUT GQ\r\nFor more than 50 years, GQ has been the premier men\u2019s magazine, providing definitive coverage of style, culture, politics and more.

                "description": "Walmart and Target, two of the biggest retailers in the US, have privately warned President Trump that their customers may face empty shelves in the coming weeks if his tariff policies continue, according to the BBC\u2019s US partner CBS News.  \n\nThere\u2019s evidence that the prohibitive level of tariffs imposed between China and the US are having a major impact on trade volumes.  Ports on the US west coast, in particular Los Angeles, are reporting a collapse in China  to US cargos, down 33% in the past week and expected to be down as much as 44% in the first week of May.\n\nWalmart and Target are among the biggest retailers in the United States providing goods for millions of customers.  Both companies had already warned that the tariffs trade war could lead to higher prices. \n\nThe Trump administration has levied 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on most other countries.  It has also imposed 25% tariffs on vehicle imports to the US.  It\u2019s led to sharp falls in stock markets around the world along with fears of surging inflation and a slowdown in economic growth.\n\nPresident Trump has said his tariff policies with reinvigorate US manufacturing.  He\u2019s seeking to negotiate new trade deals and reach agreement with China, predicting that the current level of tariffs will come down significantly.\n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting from Faisal Islam in Washington.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

Ports on the US west coast, in particular Los Angeles, are reporting a collapse in China  to US cargos, down 33% in the past week and expected to be down as much as 44% in the first week of May.\n\nWalmart and Target are among the biggest retailers in the United States providing goods for millions of customers.  Both companies had already warned that the tariffs trade war could lead to higher prices. \n\nThe Trump administration has levied 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on most other countries.  It has also imposed 25% tariffs on vehicle imports to the US.  It\u2019s led to sharp falls in stock markets around the world along with fears of surging inflation and a slowdown in economic growth.\n\nPresident Trump has said his tariff policies with reinvigorate US manufacturing.  He\u2019s seeking to negotiate new trade deals and reach agreement with China, predicting that the current level of tariffs will come down significantly.\n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting from Faisal Islam in Washington.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews"

                "description": "Welcome to 2025 and the Elder Scrolls Oblivion remaster is about to be announced or released depending on whatever the whim of Todd Howard and Bethesda might be. (OK POST VIDEO UPLOAD YEAH THEY JUST RELEASED IT!!!!) So with Bethesda Softworks hard at work on something new I felt it was the perfect time for the spiffing brit to return to oblivion and break it just one last time and create a perfect character that can become a god! So can I find The Last Glitch in all oblivion and pull off an exploit that has eluded myself and most of the internet for so many years! \n\nSo sit back and get comfortable as we will find out if The Elder Scrolls Oblivion Is A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits or if perhaps todd howard just added some more special gameplay features! \nThis video is going to be packed with funny clips in a montage style of british humor!

(OK POST VIDEO UPLOAD YEAH THEY JUST RELEASED IT!!!!) So with Bethesda Softworks hard at work on something new I felt it was the perfect time for the spiffing brit to return to oblivion and break it just one last time and create a perfect character that can become a god! So can I find The Last Glitch in all oblivion and pull off an exploit that has eluded myself and most of the internet for so many years! \n\nSo sit back and get comfortable as we will find out if The Elder Scrolls Oblivion Is A Perfectly Balanced Game With No Exploits or if perhaps todd howard just added some more special gameplay features! \nThis video is going to be packed with funny clips in a montage style of british humor! If you enjoyed this then check out my other exploit videos featuring  strategy games and complaints about what todd howard might do to custom magic spells in Elder Scrolls 6( not as good as morrowind)! It is also rather similar to Robbaz , Valefisk and RT Game in style of content!
