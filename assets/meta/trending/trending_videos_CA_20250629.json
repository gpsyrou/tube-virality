And even though it's considered perfect, I promise that someday, somehow, I'm going to escape. \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable Universe series where he broke into Minecraft's Most Secure Prisons or got Hunted by Minecraft's Deadliest Players. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with rekrap2, Grian or MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @Wifies @jumperwho @HoraceMinecraft \n\nThis is Episode 6 of Season 2 Parrot Videos on the Unstable SMP :)\n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags aim to tell the best stories possible.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

And even though it's considered perfect, I promise that someday, somehow, I'm going to escape. \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable Universe series where he broke into Minecraft's Most Secure Prisons or got Hunted by Minecraft's Deadliest Players. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with rekrap2, Grian or MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @Wifies @jumperwho @HoraceMinecraft \n\nThis is Episode 6 of Season 2 Parrot Videos on the Unstable SMP :)\n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags aim to tell the best stories possible.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy!"

I\u2019m from the US but I\u2019ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

I\u2019m from the US but I\u2019ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. \n \nIf you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet\u00ad-to-\u00adbe\u00ad-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cROBUX\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #RobloxForsaken #Forsaken #RobloxHorror #Horror #xDemon #Goobers",

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet\u00ad-to-\u00adbe\u00ad-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cROBUX\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #RobloxForsaken #Forsaken #RobloxHorror #Horror #xDemon #Goobers"
