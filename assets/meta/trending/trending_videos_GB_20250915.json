Design, build, and manage your own waterpark. From crazy slides to tasty snacks, every detail is yours to control.\n\nCreate custom waterslides, unique pools, themed attractions, and everything else a fun, functional waterpark needs.\n\nSpray your guests with water guns, launch beach balls at their heads, or maybe give a nervous diver a \u201cgentle\u201d push off the board. It\u2019s your park you make the rules!\n\nIn the beginning, it\u2019s all on you. From selling tickets, serving food, saving drowning guests, fixing broken slides, cleaning up after visitors, to scooping poop out of the pool. It\u2019s chaotic, hands-on, and all part of running a successful waterpark.\n\nPaint walls and slides, spray custom designs onto any surface, and swap out flooring to set the tone of each area. Add props, signs, and decorations to give your park a personal touch and make every corner feel uniquely yours.\n\nLaunch guests into the air, send them flying into pools, or watch them flop helplessly after slipping on a puddle. Ragdoll physics turn every moment into a potential comedy highlight.\n\nKeep your guests happy by setting up food stands and vending machines around your park. Prepare hot dogs, lemonade, ice cream and more!. The better the treats, the happier the visitors. \n\nEverything you do affects your park\u2019s overall rating from how clean it is, to how fun your slides are, to the quality of your food and amenities. The happier your guests are, the better your rating. Keep them satisfied and they\u2019ll stay longer, spend more, and want to come back.\n\nAs your park gets more popular, it\u2019s time to expand. Unlock new areas to grow your waterpark\u2019s size and hire staff to handle the daily chaos. With a team in place, you can focus on what really matters: building the best waterpark possible.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

The villain series is BACK! So this time round I wanted to do something a little fun and different, instead of the usual \u2018revenge\u2019 villain arch I thought it\u2019d be fun to turn Wendy into a murderous zombie and so that\u2019s what I did! I don\u2019t think it turned out too bad \ud83d\ude09 \n\nAlso BIG NEWS, im releasing my debut album on October 11th?!?! Presave here - https://ffm.to/thewoodsdebutalbum.OYD\n\nWe\u2019ve been working non stop for the better part of a year to bring this \ufffcproject to you and it\u2019s almost release day! This album means the actual WORLD to me so if youve ever enjoyed a villain song or any of my songs id massively appreciate you pre-saving it ! Also if you dont pre-save it then you must hate my cat and thats just MEAN. If you\u2019re keen on helping me then here\u2019s a to do list \n\nHOW TO HELP LYDIA TAKE OVER THE WORLD\n\nSTEP 1 - pre-save her album here - https://ffm.to/thewoodsdebutalbum.OYD\n\nSTEP 2 - mark Oct 11th in your calendar and stream it the whole way through on release day (important to stream the whole way as that tells algorithms it\u2019s worth sharing to new listeners!)\n\nSTEP 3 - save the albun to your library and add to your personal playlist!\n\nAnd then the woodland creatures will finally achieve works domination   \n\nNow what youve all been waiting for WENDYS VILLAIN STORY\n\nSTORY \nTinkerbell is dead. But her conquest has left its mark on Neverland. Fairies no longer die and humans on the mainland worship them like gods. Never before has this much energy and power coursed throughout the land. Plants flourish more than ever before and the air is thick with the heady scent of life. Decadent, overwhelming, cloying. Something is wrong.\n\nBelief rooted in hope and trust is pure and powerful, but belief born of fear and control? That becomes twisted, dangerous. The power saturating Neverland is corrupt, steeped in fear. Though the world seems to awaken, a dark undertone hums beneath the surface. Human belief is life giving\u2026 and things long thought dead are stirring. Dreams turned nightmares whisper in the air, \u2018Where is Peter Pan? And how can I ensure we are never separated again?\u2019\n\nLYRICS \n\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking up \nShe\u2019s waking \nShe\u2019s waking up \n\nMy Romeo\nMust be going mad not knowing where I\u2019ve been \nOh don\u2019t you know \nMy love is stronger than the song the heavens sing \n\nMy Prince Charming \nYou cant go hiding I live in your heart \nMy sweet darling \nI\u2019m under your skin don\u2019t make me rip it apart \n\nI gave my life up left my family for you \nEven the stars up in the night sky dance along to our tune \nTell me now Peter, say that you love me too \nWont you\nWon\u2019t you\nOh won\u2019t you \n\nDie die die for me\nOh won\u2019t you join me, \nlove adore me, \ntake the fall for me \n\nDie die die for me \nI love you baby \nIm not crazy \nIt\u2019s just you I need \n\nDieings a waste for someone your age \noh what a tragic end\nBut come to think of it \nhow long have you been twelve again \nSo say your goodbyes settle affairs and then take the knee \nOh won\u2019t you do you know that you\u2019d die for me \n\nMy destiny \nI feel your heart beat bursting at the seams\nOh My melody \nLet\u2019s bleed you out to make more room for me \n\nI see the way you turn your head aside\nSo in love you that can\u2019t quite meet my eyes \nBut buck up baby, better get on your tie\nThe wedding bells ring out tonight \n\nOur roses red\nAnd our skins tinted blue \nOh Let\u2019s strike up the band \nAnd say our I dos!\n\nMy love you refuse?\nWell I have bad news \nOh you won\u2019t get any younger \nJoin me six feet under \nAnd say your adues \n\nDie die die for me\nOh won\u2019t you join me, \nlove adore me, \ntake the fall for me \n\nDie die die for me \nI love you baby \nIm not crazy \nIt\u2019s just you I need \n\nDieings a waste for someone your age \noh what a tragic end\nBut come to think of it \nhow long have you been twelve again \nSo say your goodbyes settle affairs and then take the knee \nOh won\u2019t you do you know that you\u2019d die for me \n\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking up \nShe\u2019s waking \nShe\u2019s waking up \n\n\u2728CREDITS\u2728\n\nVocals / Lyrics - Lydia the Bard \n\nMusic - @tonyhalliwellmusic https://www.tony-halliwell-music.com\n\nAnimatic - @lazyeule \n\n#wendysvillainsong #villainsong #tinkerbell #animatic",
