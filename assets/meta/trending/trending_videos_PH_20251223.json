Back to 2 hunters, how will it compare to before?\n\nFollow my socials:\n\u27bd Twitter - @dream\n\u27bd Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n\u27bd Snapchat - @dream\n\nGeorge:  @GeorgeNotFound \nSapnap:  @Sapnap \n\nSeed: -8711203303937981073\nVersion: 1.21.10\n\nExtra Scenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_aWoXvH2hk\n\nWe decided to call this series Minecraft Manhunt. This video is a different rendition of it, where there is TWO hunters. The rematch to the original 2 hunters video.\n\nThis is a new Minecraft but, 1.21.10 challenge that we have decided to try. I try to beat the game, while my friends George and Sapnap try to prevent me from doing it. It's a race, and it's super intense and we had a lot of laughs. I love doing these challenges.\n\nNot Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that. This is a speed run / speed runner of Minecraft against a killer / assassin\n\nMusic is from: \u200b\u2060  @dreamproductionsXD  \n\n#MinecraftManhunt",
