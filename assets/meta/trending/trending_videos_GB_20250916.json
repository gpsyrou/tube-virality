Denji worked as a Devil Hunter for the yakuza, trying to pay off the debt he inherited from his parents, until the yakuza betrayed him and had him killed. As he was losing consciousness, Denji\u2019s beloved chainsaw-powered devil-dog, Pochita, made a deal with Denji and saved his life. This fused the two together, creating the unstoppable Chainsaw Man.

Recorded on a 4-track recorder in Springsteen\u2019s New Jersey bedroom, the album marked a pivotal time in his life and is considered one of his most enduring works\u2014a raw, haunted acoustic record populated by lost souls searching for a reason to believe. \n \n\u201c\u2018Nebraska\u2019 is where Bruce chose truth over expectation\u2014a choice that still reverberates through everything he\u2019s written since. At that crossroads, he could have chased the bright lights and the roar of arenas, but instead he turned inward, armed only with silence, a four-track recorder, and the courage to confront himself.

Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."
