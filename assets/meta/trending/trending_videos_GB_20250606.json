Watch the #WickedForGood trailer now  \ud83e\uddf9\ud83e\udee7\n\nPre-save \u2018Wicked: For Good \u2013 The Soundtrack\u2019 at https://wickedthesoundtrack.com\n-----\nTikTok: tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook: FACEBOOK.com/wickedmovie \nX: x.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram: instagram.com/wickedmovie\nOfficial Site: www.wickedmovie.com\n\nAnd now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend \u2026\n\nLast year\u2019s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. \n\nDirected once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award\u00ae nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz\u2019s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar\u00ae winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda\u2019s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba\u2019s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda\u2019s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba\u2019s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone. The executive producers are Stephen Schwartz, David Nicksay, Jared LeBoff, Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. The first film, Wicked, released in November 2024, earned 10 Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including Best Picture, and won the Oscars\u00ae for Costume Design and Production Design. To date, the film has grossed $750 million worldwide. \n\nWicked: For Good is based on the generation-defining musical stage play with music and lyrics by legendary Grammy and Oscar\u00ae winning composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman, from the bestselling novel by Gregory Maguire. The screenplay is by Winnie Holzman and Winnie Holzman & Dana Fox. The film score is by John Powell & Stephen Schwartz, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz.",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                "description": "Today we're speedrunning Phineas and Ferb games, and some of these are suprisingly amazing for speedruns\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n\u25b6 Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n\u25b6 Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n\u25b6 Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nGame timestamps:\n0:00 Agent P: Strikes Back\n5:31 Perry Widgets\n9:04 Transport-inators of Doom\n19:53 Gadget Golf\n22:44 Heroes of Danville\n24:53 Tower-inator\n28:55 Agent P: Rebel Spy\n35:53 Dimension of Doom\n42:50 Escape from Mole-Tropolis\n49:24 Gadget Golf Winter Holiday Edition\n\nFor this video I tried speedrunning every Phineas and Ferb flash games that I could get working, and had a speedrun leaderboard. Unfortunately though I couldn't get the game called Droid Masters to work so couldn't add that one in. I also did the speedrun for Agent P: Return of the Platypus, but it's way too similar to Rebel Spy so I left it out\n\nAlso since I just did webgames, let me know if I should try speedrunning something like Across the 2nd Dimension at some point!\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #PhineasAndFerb #Speedrun",

                    "description": "Today we're speedrunning Phineas and Ferb games, and some of these are suprisingly amazing for speedruns\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n\u25b6 Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n\u25b6 Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n\u25b6 Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nGame timestamps:\n0:00 Agent P: Strikes Back\n5:31 Perry Widgets\n9:04 Transport-inators of Doom\n19:53 Gadget Golf\n22:44 Heroes of Danville\n24:53 Tower-inator\n28:55 Agent P: Rebel Spy\n35:53 Dimension of Doom\n42:50 Escape from Mole-Tropolis\n49:24 Gadget Golf Winter Holiday Edition\n\nFor this video I tried speedrunning every Phineas and Ferb flash games that I could get working, and had a speedrun leaderboard. Unfortunately though I couldn't get the game called Droid Masters to work so couldn't add that one in. I also did the speedrun for Agent P: Return of the Platypus, but it's way too similar to Rebel Spy so I left it out\n\nAlso since I just did webgames, let me know if I should try speedrunning something like Across the 2nd Dimension at some point!\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\n#EazySpeezy #PhineasAndFerb #Speedrun"
