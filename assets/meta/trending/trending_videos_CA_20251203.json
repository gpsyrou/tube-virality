(Like you)\nYou just too important\nNobody do body like you do\nI can't lose when I'm with you (Like you)\nHow can I snooze and miss the moment? (Like you)\nYou just too important\nNobody do body like you do, you do\n\n[Outro]\nNah, nah, nah, nah\nI think I know, woah\nSee, no, I can't lose, oh\nI think I know, oh\n\n\ud83d\udce7 Contact: mgmt.moonshine@gmail.com\n\n#sza  #snooze  #lyrics"
