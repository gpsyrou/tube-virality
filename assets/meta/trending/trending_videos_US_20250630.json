                "description": "FNaF World is one of my favorite free games ever made, but unfortunately my bank account is in the negative so I can\u2019t afford anything free anymore. I went to Vegas last month and bet my entire savings account (and then some!) on black, thinking my YouTuber luck would carry over. Spoiler alert, it didn\u2019t. Thankfully, I can still play the FNaF World Demo even though I\u2019m in debt, so here I am trying to figure out a way to make content out of it. I guess I haven\u2019t made the obligatory 100%ing FNaF World video yet like everyone else, so now I\u2019ve decided to try and 100% the game with the added twist of doing it inside of the FNaF World Demo. This seems a lot simpler than it truly was however, as many literal barriers are found within the world halting your progress, and you can\u2019t even use most of the characters! I would say if this video does well I can pay off my debts, but I actually think I already have in the process of making this! I think my terrible luck with pokemon cards finally decided to go away, as the other day I opened a booster bundle of Prismatic Evolutions and pulled a beautiful Eevee EX SIR, which is worth about 140 dollars. I haven\u2019t really told any of my friends that I pulled the card though, so if you\u2019re reading this I guess you\u2019ve got some elite TheDapperWaffle knowledge to totally impress your friends!

                "description": "Iran has warned Donald Trump that there will be a response to the US bombing of three key nuclear enrichment facilities.  \n\nIran's foreign minister warned of \"everlasting consequences\" to the \"outrageous\" strikes.   Its elite military force, the Revolutionary Guard, warned that US bases and forces in the region were \u201cvulnerable\u201d.     Iran\u2019s Parliament backed the closure of the Strait of Hormuz - a key transit route for global oil supplies. S\n\nIran\u2019s immediate response was to fire a new barrage of missiles at Israel, which began the war when it attacked Iran\u2019s nuclear sites ten days ago.   Iranian missiles hit residential buildings in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa, injuring around 80 people. \n\nPresident Donald Trump claimed the US strikes had \u201ctotally obliterated\" Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and told Tehran to \"make peace\" or face \"far greater\" attacks in future. \n\nJane Hill presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith, Gordon Corera, Faisal Islam, Chris Mason, Siavash Ardalan, Orla Guerin, Lucy Williamson and Lyse Doucet. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
