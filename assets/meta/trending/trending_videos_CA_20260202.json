ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                "description": "2025 was another reminder of why America is the strongest region out there: Global Champs, the best rookies, the MVP, and fans that honestly feel unmatched. For 2026, we\u2019re going bigger: more matches, a new roadshow finals experience for Stage 2, and hosting the first international event of the year with Masters Santiago. As we look ahead to the new season, we say goodbye to some legends but welcome ENVY who will be joining us to show his dominance across Challengers.\nThe road to Champions Shanghai is long, and it all starts with VCT Americas Kickoff, where we\u2019ll get our first look at 12 of the best teams in the world. Step one: conquer Kickoff and grab one of the three tickets to represent the region at Masters Santiago. So\u2026 who you got?\nWe\u2019re proud to work with our fantastic partners throughout 2026: Aim Lab, Pulsar, Red Bull, Samsung, Secretlab, and Verizon.\nFollow the below channels to get the latest information on VCT Americas:\nTwitter/X: https://www.x.com/valesportsna\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@valesportsna\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/valesportsna\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/valorant_americas\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@valorant_americas\nPhotos from the Event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/vctamericas/\nOfficial VALORANT Esports News: https://www.valorantesports.com/news\nWeb: https://www.valorantesports.com\n\n#VCTAmericas #VCT",

For 2026, we\u2019re going bigger: more matches, a new roadshow finals experience for Stage 2, and hosting the first international event of the year with Masters Santiago. As we look ahead to the new season, we say goodbye to some legends but welcome ENVY who will be joining us to show his dominance across Challengers.\nThe road to Champions Shanghai is long, and it all starts with VCT Americas Kickoff, where we\u2019ll get our first look at 12 of the best teams in the world. Step one: conquer Kickoff and grab one of the three tickets to represent the region at Masters Santiago. So\u2026 who you got?\nWe\u2019re proud to work with our fantastic partners throughout 2026: Aim Lab, Pulsar, Red Bull, Samsung, Secretlab, and Verizon.\nFollow the below channels to get the latest information on VCT Americas:\nTwitter/X: https://www.x.com/valesportsna\nTik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@valesportsna\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/valesportsna\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/valorant_americas\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@valorant_americas\nPhotos from the Event: https://www.flickr.com/photos/vctamericas/\nOfficial VALORANT Esports News: https://www.valorantesports.com/news\nWeb: https://www.valorantesports.com\n\n#VCTAmericas #VCT"
