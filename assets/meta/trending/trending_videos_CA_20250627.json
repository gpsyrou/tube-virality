With the Natural Living Skill, Sims can meet their needs outdoors without beds or plumbing. This'll be uncomfortable at first, but Sims will find themselves feeling more at home in nature as they improve the skill. Sleeping on the ground, relieving themselves in Privy Bushes, and eating food they find while Foraging are some of the ways Sims can meet their needs out among the trees. \n \nThis wonderous world is also home to Fairy Sims. Fairies have stunning wings and can develop fantastical abilities that let them nurture plants, change the moods of others, and a whole lot more. A kindly Fairy might improve a Sim's luck, while one that's feeling mischievous might bestow an Ailment. Fairies also produce Fairy Dust, which any Sim can use to enchant plants or bring Gnomes to life. Fairy Dust can also be found in the world. \n \nAnother way for any Sim to get a taste of the mystical is through the Apothecary Skill, which allows you to craft useful Elixirs as well as Cures for Ailments. Ailments happen when Sims are unbalanced, and the effects are not always negative but they can be quite curious. For example, one Ailment will attract tons of Gnomes to the afflicted Sim's lot and another improves a Sim's luck by leeching good luck from everyone around them. \n \nAvailable July 10 at 10AM PT on EA App PC/Mac, Steam, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation\u00ae4, and PlayStation\u00ae5.
