The only way to beat him, is to bring Wemmbu back to spawn and prove that he's been lying this whole time.

This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @wemmbumc @LettuceK @TheobaldTheBird @CoinMonkeExtras @PurpledMC @Boosfer \n\nOriginal music by  @tsynphonia \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

behisaab kyu\nAasu behisaab\nKhair hai yaaron kam se kam\nJaan se jaa na paaye hum\nKhair hai yaaron kam se kam\nJaan se jaa na paaye hum\nInkaar ke bahaane kayi baar karte karte\n\nHumne wahin lagaya dil\nJahaan dil lagana mana tha\nAkhir wahin kiye sajde jahan\nSar jhukana mana tha\nKyu zindagi bita di jahaan pe\nik pal bitaana mana tha\nKyu us gali mein rehte they hum\nJahaan roz jaana mana tha\n\nZamaane ki taraah\nHum bhi tode hain gaye\nAise tanha to na the Tanha chode hain gaye\nJo duaayein dete they\nHaan usi ke hothon se\nAise waise lafz bhi\nHumse bole hain gaye\n\nbaitho kisi roz tanhai mein\nRakho samne wakt ke aaine\nJo aagea chehra nazar vo kahin\nTumhe bewafa kehke has na pade\n\nTujhe dil diya istemaal huye\nHai tujhmein bhi dil ye khayaal rahe\nTujhe dil diya istemaal huye\nHai tujhmein bhi dil ye khayaal rahe\n\nHumne jalaaya dil jahaan diye bhi jalaana mana tha\nKar baithe yaad vo chehra jisko bhulaana mana tha\nHum aazmaye gaye magar unhe aazmana mana tha\nHumne wahin lagaya dil jahan dil lagana mana tha\n\nZamaane ki taraah\nHum bhi tode hain gaye\nAise tanha to na the Tanha chode hain gaye\nJo duaayein dete they\nHaan usi ke hothon se\nAise waise lafz
