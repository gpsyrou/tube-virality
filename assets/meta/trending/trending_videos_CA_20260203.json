ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

In union born, in union quelled.\nTo hold a day as a passing year, illuminate the heart that was.\nSinger: Alan\n\nEnglish Translation:\nThe moon, a jade plate, climbs the misty skies\nThin dewdrops gleam as they fall like sighs\nWhich grass shall never yellow in the fleeting day?\nWhich virtue lasts while seasons slip away?\nLike drifting dust along the country way\nThe grass lies pale, the poplars sere, yet the end delays\nBy the roadside, the remnants keep their rites\nAs bronze statues of old lie lost in thorn and briar\nAll things keep their seasons, past all mortal measure\nPassing through this mortal world like a waking dream\nLike drifting shadows, fleeting, swift, and bright\nTime races on, a white steed through the desolate plain\nIts path unknown, its destination unseen\nWhich grass shall never yellow in the fleeting day?\nWhich virtue lasts while seasons slip away?\nLike drifting dust along the country way\nAlone with my staff, I cross the river on a single reed, like a lone wild goose in flight\nWho says the river is too wide to cross?\nThrough shadowed reeds I seek the broken jade\nThe past cannot be undone, the road ahead stretches long\nFriends spread the mat and share their wine, while distant fields of millet sway and shine\nSome till the soil, some sow the seed \u2014 this is the life the people long to lead\nIn desolate courts, the withered grass sways in the moon's pale beam, and waning decay glimmers as fireflies' dream\n\nChinese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/PuI3bYK5UAk\nJapanese Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/t4xEbesXXtg\nKorean Voice-Over Video: https://youtu.be/w6m9upfyq6w\n\nDownload FREE: https://hoyo.link/eP8hFBAL\n#GenshinImpact #HoYoverse\n\n\u2193 Follow us for the latest news \u2193\nHoYoLAB: https://hoyo.link/34115CA6\nOfficial Website: https://hoyo.link/b7SCBOAd\nOfficial Community: https://hoyo.link/52uYBBAd\nFacebook: https://hoyo.link/77SCB0Ad\nTwitter: https://hoyo.link/7bSCBxAd\nTwitch: https://hoyo.link/4bSCBFAd\nInstagram: https://hoyo.link/a6SCBEAd\nReddit: https://hoyo.link/c1SCBIAd\nDiscord: https://hoyo.link/8QRlFBAL",
