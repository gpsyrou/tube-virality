As Earth\u2019s heroes stand divided, Sam Wilson\u2019s Captain America attempts to rebuild the Avengers while rival teams and uneasy alliances complicate any hope of unity. The arrival of the Fantastic Four from another reality and the long-awaited emergence of the X-Men signal that the conflict can no longer be contained within a single universe. With incursions threatening to collapse entire timelines, Doom\u2019s ideology challenges heroes and gods alike, drawing figures like Loki into a battle over who truly holds the right to shape existence.

                "description": "A film by Steven Spielberg. Disclosure Day is in theaters 06.12.26.\n\nIf you found out we weren\u2019t alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. \nWe are coming close to \u2026 Disclosure Day. \n\nUniversal Pictures is proud to release a new original event film created and directed by Steven Spielberg. The film stars SAG winner and Oscar\u00ae nominee Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place), Emmy and Golden Globe winner Josh O\u2019Connor (Challengers, The Crown), Oscar\u00ae winner Colin Firth (The King\u2019s Speech, Kingsman franchise), Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, The Perfect Couple) and two-time Oscar\u00ae nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nBased on a story by Spielberg, the screenplay is by David Koepp, whose previous work with Spielberg includes the scripts for Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Combined, those films earned more than $3 billion worldwide. Koepp also wrote the script for this 2025\u2019s Jurassic World Rebirth. \n\nDisclosure Day is produced by five-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee Kristie Macosko Krieger (The Fabelmans, West Side Story) and by Spielberg for Amblin Entertainment. The executive producers are Adam Somner and Chris Brigham. \n\nSteven Spielberg is one of the industry\u2019s most successful and influential filmmakers. The top-grossing director of all time, Spielberg has helmed such blockbusters as Jaws, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, the Indiana Jones franchise and Jurassic Park. \n \nAmong his myriad honors, he is a three-time Academy Award\u00ae winner, including Oscars\u00ae for Best Director and Best Picture for Schindler\u2019s List, which received a total of seven Oscars\u00ae, and for Best Director for Saving Private Ryan. His most recent film, The Fabelmans, was released by Universal in 2022 and received seven Academy Award\u00ae nominations, including for Directing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Picture. \n\nWebsite: http://disclosuredaymovie.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/disclosuredayfilm/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/disclosureday/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@universalpics?lang=en\nX: https://x.com/disclosureday\nHashtag: #DisclosureDay",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects.
