Are you sad?\nAre you always gonna hate me for that night in Tokyo? \nWhen it ended \nI kinda hoped that it\u2019d be open ended\nBut you never looked back \nWell I guess you can\u2019t hold on to something once you let it go \nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI guess that I\u2019m taking what I can get \n\u2018Cause I don\u2019t get nothing new from your friends \nIf you got the harder side of the break \nThen why is it harder for me to take \nThere\u2019s so much I might never get to say, ay\nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI-I-I know it\u2019s only in my mind\nPlaying three nights on the stereo\nLike a movie scene, DiCaprio \nOh l-I-I put my make up on just to fall asleep\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is something we\u2019ll never be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nCan we be friends at least\n\nCredits:\nStarring.\nLalisa Manobal\nKentaro Sakaguchi\n\nA film by ARFILM @arfilm_ojun\nWritten & Directed by OJun Kwon\n\nAssistant Director.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects.
