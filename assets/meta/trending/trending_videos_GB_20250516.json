                "description": "Gary Sinise shares his story of stepping away from Hollywood to care for his family and grieve the unimaginable loss of his son, Mac. The actor opens up for the first time about Mac\u2019s battle with chordoma, a rare, slow-growing spinal cancer, and the strength his son showed throughout his illness: \u201cThe way he dealt with it was just pure grace and courage.\u201d He reveals the moment they discovered Mac\u2019s tumor on a CT scan, after months of unexplained pain: \u201cIt looks like a monster grabbing my son\u2019s spine.\u201d Gary reflects on a harrowing period that began with his father\u2019s stroke, followed by his wife\u2019s stage 3 breast cancer treatment and his son\u2019s shocking diagnosis \u2014 and the decision he made to pause acting to care for them. Mac passed away on January 5, 2024. Gary\u2019s wife is now cancer-free.\n\nHe has continued his work with the Gary Sinise Foundation, which supports veterans, first responders, and their families. Gary recently produced \u2018Brothers After War\u2019, a documentary about wounded heroes returning from combat, and is helping release Mac\u2019s final music. The songs are now available, with proceeds going to the Foundation in honor of Mac\u2019s wishes. Gary also shares the joy he finds in being a grandfather, a role that brings light amid the pain. He will return to Washington, D.C. to host the Foundation\u2019s annual Memorial Day concert. Gary Sinise offers an intimate look at life, loss, and legacy in the wake of profound personal tragedy.\n\nRead more: https://people.com/gary-sinise-leaving-hollywood-losing-son-to-cancer-exclusive-11733744\n\nhttps://www.garysinisefoundation.org/mac-tribute\n\nhttps://www.chordomafoundation.org/path-to-cures/mac-fund/\n\nSubscribe to People \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.

                    "description": "Gary Sinise shares his story of stepping away from Hollywood to care for his family and grieve the unimaginable loss of his son, Mac. The actor opens up for the first time about Mac\u2019s battle with chordoma, a rare, slow-growing spinal cancer, and the strength his son showed throughout his illness: \u201cThe way he dealt with it was just pure grace and courage.\u201d He reveals the moment they discovered Mac\u2019s tumor on a CT scan, after months of unexplained pain: \u201cIt looks like a monster grabbing my son\u2019s spine.\u201d Gary reflects on a harrowing period that began with his father\u2019s stroke, followed by his wife\u2019s stage 3 breast cancer treatment and his son\u2019s shocking diagnosis \u2014 and the decision he made to pause acting to care for them. Mac passed away on January 5, 2024. Gary\u2019s wife is now cancer-free.\n\nHe has continued his work with the Gary Sinise Foundation, which supports veterans, first responders, and their families. Gary recently produced \u2018Brothers After War\u2019, a documentary about wounded heroes returning from combat, and is helping release Mac\u2019s final music. The songs are now available, with proceeds going to the Foundation in honor of Mac\u2019s wishes. Gary also shares the joy he finds in being a grandfather, a role that brings light amid the pain. He will return to Washington, D.C. to host the Foundation\u2019s annual Memorial Day concert. Gary Sinise offers an intimate look at life, loss, and legacy in the wake of profound personal tragedy.\n\nRead more: https://people.com/gary-sinise-leaving-hollywood-losing-son-to-cancer-exclusive-11733744\n\nhttps://www.garysinisefoundation.org/mac-tribute\n\nhttps://www.chordomafoundation.org/path-to-cures/mac-fund/\n\nSubscribe to People \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/SubscribetoPeople \n\n*CONNECT*\nWeb: https://people.com \nFacebook: http://facebook.com/peoplemag \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/people/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@people\n\n*PEOPLE* remains the trusted authority at the center of pop culture.
