ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

This is where his story begins.\n \nMichael stars Jaafar Jackson in his feature film debut, Nia Long (Empire, The Best Man franchise), Laura Harrier (BlacKkKlansman, Spider-Man: Homecoming) and Juliano Krue Valdi (The Loud House, Arco), with Miles Teller (Top Gun: Maverick, Whiplash) and two-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee Colman Domingo (Sing Sing, Rustin).\n \nDirected by Antoine Fuqua, the award-winning filmmaker of Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen and The Equalizer franchise, from a screenplay by three-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator), the film is produced by Academy Award\u00ae winner Graham King (The Departed, Bohemian Rhapsody), John Branca (executive producer This Is It, Thriller 40) and John McClain (executive producer This Is It, Michael Jackson Live at Wembley July 16, 1988).",

I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nLet him know that you know best\n'Cause after all, you do know best\nYou try to slip past his defense\nWithout granting innocence\nLay down a list of what is wrong\nThe things you've told him all along\nPray to God he hears you\nAnd pray to God he hears you\nAnd where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nAs he begins to raise his voice\nYou lower yours and grant him one last choice\nDrive until you lose the road\nOr break with the ones you've followed\nHe will do one of two things\nHe will admit to everything\nOr he'll say he's just not the same\nAnd you'll begin to wonder why you came\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend (where did I go wrong?)\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night (and I would have stayed up)\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\n\nContact: deadradioclubmusic@gmail.com\n_________________________________________________\nThe Fray - How To Save A Life\nReleased 07/07/2006\n\n\n#TheFray\n#pop\n#rock",

I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nLet him know that you know best\n'Cause after all, you do know best\nYou try to slip past his defense\nWithout granting innocence\nLay down a list of what is wrong\nThe things you've told him all along\nPray to God he hears you\nAnd pray to God he hears you\nAnd where did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nAs he begins to raise his voice\nYou lower yours and grant him one last choice\nDrive until you lose the road\nOr break with the ones you've followed\nHe will do one of two things\nHe will admit to everything\nOr he'll say he's just not the same\nAnd you'll begin to wonder why you came\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night\nHad I known how to save a life\nWhere did I go wrong? I lost a friend (where did I go wrong?)\nSomewhere along in the bitterness\nAnd I would have stayed up with you all night (and I would have stayed up)\nHad I known how to save a life\nHow to save a life\nHow to save a life\n\nContact: deadradioclubmusic@gmail.com\n_________________________________________________\nThe Fray - How To Save A Life\nReleased 07/07/2006\n\n\n#TheFray\n#pop\n#rock"
