The trailer opens with a quiet moment between Dom and Letty, driving side by side and reflecting on what \u201cfamily\u201d truly means after everything they\u2019ve been through. It sets a reflective tone right away, signaling that something deeper is coming.\n\nThe turning point arrives when Tej pulls up beside Dom and asks, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Brian\u2019s back?\u201d That one line adds mystery and weight to the trailer\u2019s premise, hinting at a secret Dom has been keeping \u2014 perhaps to protect Brian, or maybe because he still can't believe it himself. I carefully edited their reactions to feel natural, using flashbacks and slower-paced scenes to give the moment impact. Like my previous version, I kept the action grounded and character-driven, focusing on emotional beats over spectacle. This version was all about imagining how Dom would feel if Brian returned, and showing how that would shake the entire crew to their core.\n\nVIDEO CREDITS | FAST X | ROUGE SHORT FILM BY MIKE KHAKAME | TWISTED METAL | FAST & FURIOUS 6 | VEHICLE 19 | JASON STATHAM TAKES ON HOLIDAY OPS 2025 | HOURS (2013) | PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES (2023) | RED ONE | JASON MOMOA;S 2023 SNL VIDEO DIARY BY SNL | BRAVEN | END OF THE ROAD | GETAWAY DRIVER | SUNG KANG BY HAGERTY | ARMY OF THE THIEVES (2021) | REACHER S2 | KEEPING UP WITH THE JONESES | RECEXOTICS SUPER CAR RALLY (2023) | DODGE CHARGER BY RAFFAPLYMOUTH \u201cRAFFAEKE\u201d USA & EMERGENCY EXPERTS | MITSUBISHI LANCER EVO VIII | LOS ANGELES DRONE BY TAPP CHANNEL | BLACK LABEL INVITATIONAL (2022) | WHEELMAN | FX2 SUMMIT | MY FAULT: LONDON |\n\nMUSIC CREDITS | FUZZEKE - BUTTERFLY EFFECT\n\n\u25b6\ufe0f VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE | WONDERSHARE FILMORA 13\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease don't re-upload any of my videos, or needed actions will be done.\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Now, a shocking new chapter of animatronic terror begins. \n \nOne year has passed since the supernatural nightmare at Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza. The stories about what transpired there have been twisted into a campy local legend, inspiring the town\u2019s first ever Fazfest. \n \nFormer security guard Mike (Josh Hutcherson) and police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) have kept the truth from Mike\u2019s 11-year-old sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), concerning the fate of her animatronic friends. \n \nBut when Abby sneaks out to reconnect with Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, it will set into motion a terrifying series of events, revealing dark secrets about the true origin of Freddy\u2019s, and unleashing a long-forgotten horror hidden away for decades.\n \nThe cast of Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 includes returning co-stars Theodus Crane as Jeremiah and the legendary Matthew Lillard as William Afton. The film features new characters played by Freddy Carter (Shadow and Bone, Pennyworth), Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park, Seinfeld), Mckenna Grace (Ghostbusters franchise, Annabelle Comes Home) and horror icon Skeet Ulrich (Scream, Riverdale). \n \nFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 is directed by acclaimed returning filmmaker Emma Tammi and is written by game series creator Scott Cawthon.\n \nThe film is produced by Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum and Scott Cawthon, who together produced the first film. The executive producers are director Emma Tammi, Beatriz Sequeira, Christopher Warner, Russell Binder and Marc Mostman. \n \nThe first Freddy\u2019s film opened to a record-shattering $80 million in October 2023 and went on to earn almost $300 million worldwide. \n\n\nSite: https://fivenightsatfreddys.movie/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FNAFMovie/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fnafmovie\nX: https://x.com/FNAFMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@fnafmovie?lang=en",

This one for UFC 319, Dricus Du Plessis vs Khamzat Chimaev. On August 19, the middleweight champion Du Plessis will defend his throne against the undefeated Chimaev, in what is one of the most highly anticipated fights of the year. Du Plessis is on a tear, still undefeated in the UFC with beating guys like Robert Whittaker, Sean Strickland and Israel Adesanya. And now he faces the force of nature who finally gets his title shot after a destruction of Robert Whittaker at UFC 308. This one is the definition of chaos and I cannot wait for it! I hope you enjoy the video, and let me know who you think wins in the comments!\n.\nAs always, if you enjoyed the video make sure to like, subscribe, comment and share. Thank you for watching!",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"
