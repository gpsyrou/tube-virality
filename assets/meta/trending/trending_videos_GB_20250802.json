ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

                    "description": "We found a secret when we went to dig the backyard!\n\nIn this video, the Kin Tin Krew plays Dig The Backyard in Roblox! Kin Tin, Kyle, and Roro are called to help dig in the backyard of an old woman's house to find a secret item buried deep int he ground. They don't know what the item is exactly their looking for, but it's very valuable! Digging the backyard won't be easy! They'll have to gather items they dig up to sell and slowly upgrade their shovels, backpacks, and energy with the money they earn. The better their upgrades, the faster they can dig! But that's not the only thing they'll have to worry about. They'll have to avoid giant worms, groups of zombies, suspicious neighbors and.....pigeons?! Why are these pigeons staring at everyone?! Time is running out and they need to find the secret buried treasure fast! Will the Kin Tin Krew be able to Dig The Backyard fast enough or will the GIANT worm find them first?! Let's go!    \n\nPlay This Game: https://www.roblox.com/games/83704201064817/Dig-the-Backyard-Alpha\n\n\ud83d\udc51 Become an ULTIMATE Kin Tin Krew Member!:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQEjUMa3F-Em5o_JLx4PFqg/join\n\u2b50 KIN TIN MERCH HERE: https://bit.ly/3Mm7Wsi\n\n\u2705Subscribe To Kin Tin Plays https://bit.ly/3hOVkuD \n\u2705Subscribe To Our Main Channel Kin Tin https://bit.ly/2SUaUNd\n\n\u2764Thanks so much for being a part of the Kin Tin Krew!\u2764\n#roblox #gaming #obby"
