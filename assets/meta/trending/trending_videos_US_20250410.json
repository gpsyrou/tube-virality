Pictures and Legendary Pictures and starring Jason Momoa and Jack Black, A Minecraft Movie, directed by Jared Hess, is the first ever big screen, live-action adaptation of Minecraft, the best-selling video game of all time. Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits\u2014Garrett \"The Garbage Man\" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)\u2014find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative\u2026the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.  \n\nConnect with A Minecraft Movie:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/AMinecraftMovie\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@AMinecraftMovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AMinecraftMovie\nX: https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie\n\nConnect with WaterTower Music:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/watertowermusic\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@watertowermusic\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/WaterTowerMusic\nX: https://x.com/watertowermusic\nOfficial site: https://www.watertower-music.com/\n\nAbout WaterTower Music:\nWaterTower Music, the in-house label for the WarnerMedia companies, releases recorded music as rich and diverse as the companies themselves.

Despite its residence in a news building in the capital of the United States, the Tiny Desk can \u2014 when colored by the careful vision of a true artist \u2014 take you anywhere else, especially the true origins of the music. \n\nBut for the superstar, Puerto Rico is so beloved and so sacred that he could never truly forget it\u2026 and he\u2019s making sure the world sees that, too. The island is his source of inspiration and the mandate for which he wages war. Flanked by cuatros and congas, Bad Bunny wields the power of Puerto Ricans who have strummed chords and hummed lelolai for generations in efforts to keep the culture alive. \n\nAfter performing \u201cLO QUE LE PAS\u00d3 A HAWAii,\u201d San Benito tells a parable about a man drawn to his band rehearsing outside the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d the man in the story says, \u201cthat after a hundred years of colonization you keep your culture, your language, your tongue, your slang.\u201d\n\nThe Puerto Rican flag laid out before him shines; its brilliant blue is defiant and captivating. \u201cThey killed people for waving the flag,\u201d Bad Bunny sings in \u201cLA MuDANZA.\u201d But there\u2019s such joy in the expression and such vibrance in the dance. Even with his global platform, Benito\u2019s true magic is intimacy: He wants you to fall in love with Puerto Rico. We scream with him: \u201cYo soy de P f****** R!\u201d Whether you are you aren\u2019t, your heart won\u2019t know the difference.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cPIToRRO DE COCO\u201d\n\u201cVOY A LLeVARTE PA PR\u201d\n\u201cKLOuFRENS\u201d\n\u201cLO QUE LE PAS\u00d3 A HAWAii\u201d\n\u201cLA MuDANZA\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nBad Bunny: vocals\nLuis Sanz: cuatro puertorrique\u00f1o, tiple, bordon\u00faa, background vocals\nFabiola M\u00e9ndez: cuatro puertorrique\u00f1o, tiple, bordon\u00faa, background vocals\nEmanuel Santana: g\u00fcicharo, Pandero de plena, maracas, background vocals\nJulito Gast\u00f3n: congas\nKrystal Santana: bass, background vocals\nLuis Amed Irizarry: piano\nJay Anthony: bongos, percussion\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Keren Carri\u00f3n, Zayrha Rodriguez\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Virginia Lozano\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #badbunny",

                    "description": "Anamaria Sayre | April 7, 2025\nFor a moment, Bad Bunny forgot that he wasn\u2019t in Puerto Rico. Despite its residence in a news building in the capital of the United States, the Tiny Desk can \u2014 when colored by the careful vision of a true artist \u2014 take you anywhere else, especially the true origins of the music. \n\nBut for the superstar, Puerto Rico is so beloved and so sacred that he could never truly forget it\u2026 and he\u2019s making sure the world sees that, too. The island is his source of inspiration and the mandate for which he wages war. Flanked by cuatros and congas, Bad Bunny wields the power of Puerto Ricans who have strummed chords and hummed lelolai for generations in efforts to keep the culture alive. \n\nAfter performing \u201cLO QUE LE PAS\u00d3 A HAWAii,\u201d San Benito tells a parable about a man drawn to his band rehearsing outside the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d the man in the story says, \u201cthat after a hundred years of colonization you keep your culture, your language, your tongue, your slang.\u201d\n\nThe Puerto Rican flag laid out before him shines; its brilliant blue is defiant and captivating. \u201cThey killed people for waving the flag,\u201d Bad Bunny sings in \u201cLA MuDANZA.\u201d But there\u2019s such joy in the expression and such vibrance in the dance. Even with his global platform, Benito\u2019s true magic is intimacy: He wants you to fall in love with Puerto Rico. We scream with him: \u201cYo soy de P f****** R!\u201d Whether you are you aren\u2019t, your heart won\u2019t know the difference.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cPIToRRO DE COCO\u201d\n\u201cVOY A LLeVARTE PA PR\u201d\n\u201cKLOuFRENS\u201d\n\u201cLO QUE LE PAS\u00d3 A HAWAii\u201d\n\u201cLA MuDANZA\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS\nBad Bunny: vocals\nLuis Sanz: cuatro puertorrique\u00f1o, tiple, bordon\u00faa, background vocals\nFabiola M\u00e9ndez: cuatro puertorrique\u00f1o, tiple, bordon\u00faa, background vocals\nEmanuel Santana: g\u00fcicharo, Pandero de plena, maracas, background vocals\nJulito Gast\u00f3n: congas\nKrystal Santana: bass, background vocals\nLuis Amed Irizarry: piano\nJay Anthony: bongos, percussion\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Keren Carri\u00f3n, Zayrha Rodriguez\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Virginia Lozano\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #badbunny"
