Design, build, and manage your own waterpark. From crazy slides to tasty snacks, every detail is yours to control.\n\nCreate custom waterslides, unique pools, themed attractions, and everything else a fun, functional waterpark needs.\n\nSpray your guests with water guns, launch beach balls at their heads, or maybe give a nervous diver a \u201cgentle\u201d push off the board. It\u2019s your park you make the rules!\n\nIn the beginning, it\u2019s all on you. From selling tickets, serving food, saving drowning guests, fixing broken slides, cleaning up after visitors, to scooping poop out of the pool. It\u2019s chaotic, hands-on, and all part of running a successful waterpark.\n\nPaint walls and slides, spray custom designs onto any surface, and swap out flooring to set the tone of each area. Add props, signs, and decorations to give your park a personal touch and make every corner feel uniquely yours.\n\nLaunch guests into the air, send them flying into pools, or watch them flop helplessly after slipping on a puddle. Ragdoll physics turn every moment into a potential comedy highlight.\n\nKeep your guests happy by setting up food stands and vending machines around your park. Prepare hot dogs, lemonade, ice cream and more!. The better the treats, the happier the visitors. \n\nEverything you do affects your park\u2019s overall rating from how clean it is, to how fun your slides are, to the quality of your food and amenities. The happier your guests are, the better your rating. Keep them satisfied and they\u2019ll stay longer, spend more, and want to come back.\n\nAs your park gets more popular, it\u2019s time to expand. Unlock new areas to grow your waterpark\u2019s size and hire staff to handle the daily chaos. With a team in place, you can focus on what really matters: building the best waterpark possible.",

Design, build, and manage your own waterpark. From crazy slides to tasty snacks, every detail is yours to control.\n\nCreate custom waterslides, unique pools, themed attractions, and everything else a fun, functional waterpark needs.\n\nSpray your guests with water guns, launch beach balls at their heads, or maybe give a nervous diver a \u201cgentle\u201d push off the board. It\u2019s your park you make the rules!\n\nIn the beginning, it\u2019s all on you. From selling tickets, serving food, saving drowning guests, fixing broken slides, cleaning up after visitors, to scooping poop out of the pool. It\u2019s chaotic, hands-on, and all part of running a successful waterpark.\n\nPaint walls and slides, spray custom designs onto any surface, and swap out flooring to set the tone of each area. Add props, signs, and decorations to give your park a personal touch and make every corner feel uniquely yours.\n\nLaunch guests into the air, send them flying into pools, or watch them flop helplessly after slipping on a puddle. Ragdoll physics turn every moment into a potential comedy highlight.\n\nKeep your guests happy by setting up food stands and vending machines around your park. Prepare hot dogs, lemonade, ice cream and more!. The better the treats, the happier the visitors. \n\nEverything you do affects your park\u2019s overall rating from how clean it is, to how fun your slides are, to the quality of your food and amenities. The happier your guests are, the better your rating. Keep them satisfied and they\u2019ll stay longer, spend more, and want to come back.\n\nAs your park gets more popular, it\u2019s time to expand. Unlock new areas to grow your waterpark\u2019s size and hire staff to handle the daily chaos. With a team in place, you can focus on what really matters: building the best waterpark possible."

The villain series is BACK! So this time round I wanted to do something a little fun and different, instead of the usual \u2018revenge\u2019 villain arch I thought it\u2019d be fun to turn Wendy into a murderous zombie and so that\u2019s what I did! I don\u2019t think it turned out too bad \ud83d\ude09 \n\nAlso BIG NEWS, im releasing my debut album on October 11th?!?! Presave here - https://ffm.to/thewoodsdebutalbum.OYD\n\nWe\u2019ve been working non stop for the better part of a year to bring this \ufffcproject to you and it\u2019s almost release day! This album means the actual WORLD to me so if youve ever enjoyed a villain song or any of my songs id massively appreciate you pre-saving it ! Also if you dont pre-save it then you must hate my cat and thats just MEAN. If you\u2019re keen on helping me then here\u2019s a to do list \n\nHOW TO HELP LYDIA TAKE OVER THE WORLD\n\nSTEP 1 - pre-save her album here - https://ffm.to/thewoodsdebutalbum.OYD\n\nSTEP 2 - mark Oct 11th in your calendar and stream it the whole way through on release day (important to stream the whole way as that tells algorithms it\u2019s worth sharing to new listeners!)\n\nSTEP 3 - save the albun to your library and add to your personal playlist!\n\nAnd then the woodland creatures will finally achieve works domination   \n\nNow what youve all been waiting for WENDYS VILLAIN STORY\n\nSTORY \nTinkerbell is dead. But her conquest has left its mark on Neverland. Fairies no longer die and humans on the mainland worship them like gods. Never before has this much energy and power coursed throughout the land. Plants flourish more than ever before and the air is thick with the heady scent of life. Decadent, overwhelming, cloying. Something is wrong.\n\nBelief rooted in hope and trust is pure and powerful, but belief born of fear and control? That becomes twisted, dangerous. The power saturating Neverland is corrupt, steeped in fear. Though the world seems to awaken, a dark undertone hums beneath the surface. Human belief is life giving\u2026 and things long thought dead are stirring. Dreams turned nightmares whisper in the air, \u2018Where is Peter Pan? And how can I ensure we are never separated again?\u2019\n\nLYRICS \n\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking up \nShe\u2019s waking \nShe\u2019s waking up \n\nMy Romeo\nMust be going mad not knowing where I\u2019ve been \nOh don\u2019t you know \nMy love is stronger than the song the heavens sing \n\nMy Prince Charming \nYou cant go hiding I live in your heart \nMy sweet darling \nI\u2019m under your skin don\u2019t make me rip it apart \n\nI gave my life up left my family for you \nEven the stars up in the night sky dance along to our tune \nTell me now Peter, say that you love me too \nWont you\nWon\u2019t you\nOh won\u2019t you \n\nDie die die for me\nOh won\u2019t you join me, \nlove adore me, \ntake the fall for me \n\nDie die die for me \nI love you baby \nIm not crazy \nIt\u2019s just you I need \n\nDieings a waste for someone your age \noh what a tragic end\nBut come to think of it \nhow long have you been twelve again \nSo say your goodbyes settle affairs and then take the knee \nOh won\u2019t you do you know that you\u2019d die for me \n\nMy destiny \nI feel your heart beat bursting at the seams\nOh My melody \nLet\u2019s bleed you out to make more room for me \n\nI see the way you turn your head aside\nSo in love you that can\u2019t quite meet my eyes \nBut buck up baby, better get on your tie\nThe wedding bells ring out tonight \n\nOur roses red\nAnd our skins tinted blue \nOh Let\u2019s strike up the band \nAnd say our I dos!\n\nMy love you refuse?\nWell I have bad news \nOh you won\u2019t get any younger \nJoin me six feet under \nAnd say your adues \n\nDie die die for me\nOh won\u2019t you join me, \nlove adore me, \ntake the fall for me \n\nDie die die for me \nI love you baby \nIm not crazy \nIt\u2019s just you I need \n\nDieings a waste for someone your age \noh what a tragic end\nBut come to think of it \nhow long have you been twelve again \nSo say your goodbyes settle affairs and then take the knee \nOh won\u2019t you do you know that you\u2019d die for me \n\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking up \nShe\u2019s waking \nShe\u2019s waking up \n\n\u2728CREDITS\u2728\n\nVocals / Lyrics - Lydia the Bard \n\nMusic - @tonyhalliwellmusic https://www.tony-halliwell-music.com\n\nAnimatic - @lazyeule \n\n#wendysvillainsong #villainsong #tinkerbell #animatic",

The power saturating Neverland is corrupt, steeped in fear. Though the world seems to awaken, a dark undertone hums beneath the surface. Human belief is life giving\u2026 and things long thought dead are stirring. Dreams turned nightmares whisper in the air, \u2018Where is Peter Pan? And how can I ensure we are never separated again?\u2019\n\nLYRICS \n\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking up \nShe\u2019s waking \nShe\u2019s waking up \n\nMy Romeo\nMust be going mad not knowing where I\u2019ve been \nOh don\u2019t you know \nMy love is stronger than the song the heavens sing \n\nMy Prince Charming \nYou cant go hiding I live in your heart \nMy sweet darling \nI\u2019m under your skin don\u2019t make me rip it apart \n\nI gave my life up left my family for you \nEven the stars up in the night sky dance along to our tune \nTell me now Peter, say that you love me too \nWont you\nWon\u2019t you\nOh won\u2019t you \n\nDie die die for me\nOh won\u2019t you join me, \nlove adore me, \ntake the fall for me \n\nDie die die for me \nI love you baby \nIm not crazy \nIt\u2019s just you I need \n\nDieings a waste for someone your age \noh what a tragic end\nBut come to think of it \nhow long have you been twelve again \nSo say your goodbyes settle affairs and then take the knee \nOh won\u2019t you do you know that you\u2019d die for me \n\nMy destiny \nI feel your heart beat bursting at the seams\nOh My melody \nLet\u2019s bleed you out to make more room for me \n\nI see the way you turn your head aside\nSo in love you that can\u2019t quite meet my eyes \nBut buck up baby, better get on your tie\nThe wedding bells ring out tonight \n\nOur roses red\nAnd our skins tinted blue \nOh Let\u2019s strike up the band \nAnd say our I dos!\n\nMy love you refuse?\nWell I have bad news \nOh you won\u2019t get any younger \nJoin me six feet under \nAnd say your adues \n\nDie die die for me\nOh won\u2019t you join me, \nlove adore me, \ntake the fall for me \n\nDie die die for me \nI love you baby \nIm not crazy \nIt\u2019s just you I need \n\nDieings a waste for someone your age \noh what a tragic end\nBut come to think of it \nhow long have you been twelve again \nSo say your goodbyes settle affairs and then take the knee \nOh won\u2019t you do you know that you\u2019d die for me \n\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking\nShe\u2019s waking up \nShe\u2019s waking \nShe\u2019s waking up \n\n\u2728CREDITS\u2728\n\nVocals / Lyrics - Lydia the Bard \n\nMusic - @tonyhalliwellmusic https://www.tony-halliwell-music.com\n\nAnimatic - @lazyeule \n\n#wendysvillainsong #villainsong #tinkerbell #animatic"

Only in theaters Oct 24.\n\n\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere\u201d chronicles the making of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s 1982 \u201cNebraska\u201d album. Recorded on a 4-track recorder in Springsteen\u2019s New Jersey bedroom, the album marked a pivotal time in his life and is considered one of his most enduring works\u2014a raw, haunted acoustic record populated by lost souls searching for a reason to believe. \n \n\u201c\u2018Nebraska\u2019 is where Bruce chose truth over expectation\u2014a choice that still reverberates through everything he\u2019s written since. At that crossroads, he could have chased the bright lights and the roar of arenas, but instead he turned inward, armed only with silence, a four-track recorder, and the courage to confront himself. For him to trust me with telling that story\u2014the most vulnerable chapter of his life\u2014is the greatest honor I\u2019ve ever had as a filmmaker,\u201d says Cooper.\n \n\u201cThis film takes a couple years out of my life and looks at them very closely, a time when I made \u2018Nebraska\u2019 and went through some personal difficulties,\u201d says Springsteen. \u201cI\u2019m so appreciative of Jeremy Allen White and the entire cast for their wonderful and moving performances\u2014and Scott Cooper, one of the most generous collaborators I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d\n \nStarring Jeremy Allen White as Bruce Springsteen, the film is directed by Scott Cooper from his adaptation of Warren Zanes\u2019 book of the same name. \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere\u201d also features Jeremy Strong as Springsteen\u2019s long-time confidant and manager, Jon Landau; Paul Walter Hauser as guitar tech Mike Batlan; Odessa Young as Faye; Stephen Graham as Springsteen\u2019s father, Doug; Gaby Hoffman as Springsteen\u2019s mother, Adele; and David Krumholtz as Columbia executive, Al Teller. \n \nThe film is produced by Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson and Scott Stuber.

                "description": "Traveling magician Mr. K (Crispin Glover) is down on his luck. Business is slow, and the few gigs he\u2019s picked up along the road have left him adrift. After spending the night in a remote hotel, he is alarmed when he discovers that he is unable to find the exit. As he explores the maze-like corridors, he hears strange noises and encounters a series of curious inhabitants who have formed their own factions within the walls of the hotel. Alone and afraid, he starts mapping out the corridors, desperately hoping to get to the bottom of the building\u2019s layout before it is too late. Stuck more hopelessly than ever and about to give up, he makes a bizarre discovery that will change everything. Starring the ever-eccentric Crispin Glover, this Kafkaesque mystery offers a bold new take on falling down the rabbit hole. \n\nDirector: Tallulah H. Schwab\nCast: Crispin Glover, Sunnyi Melles, Bj\u00f8rn Sundquist, Fionnula Flanagan, Dearbhla Molloy, Jan Gunnar R\u00f8ise, Barbara Sarafian, Esm\u00e9e van Kampen, Sam Louwyck, Fabian Jansen\n\nDoppelg\u00e4nger Releasing\u2122 is the alternative, genre-inspired label of Music Box Films. Launched in 2013, Doppelg\u00e4nger Releasing supports cutting-edge films that push the boundaries of genre filmmaking.

The teaser involves a clip of a compass magnet going haywire with the caption \"Every direction leads to d***th\" with the hashtag Zombies, insinuating this is a teaser tied to Black Ops 7 Zombies. The connections to this teaser include the Bermuda Triangle and the similarity to the compass behaviour. Could this be an indication of some map mechanics that might be in the Black Ops 7 Zombies launch map? There are also jumper cables usually associated with vehicles. Maybe the Wonder Vehicle requires parts in order to power it on and use? \n\n\u2796 Follow me! \u2796\n\ud83d\udc25 Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/MrDalekJD\n\ud83d\udcd8 Facebook - http://facebook.com/MrDalekJD\n\ud83c\udfa5 TikTok - http://www.tiktok.com/@dalekjd \n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram - http://instagram.com/MrDalekJD\n\ud83d\udea8Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmn6qb15MOEDxa8DyqxIzhQ\n\ud83d\udc7e Join the MrDalekJD Discord - https://discord.gg/Wc28nWzkmB\n\n\u2796 The equipment I use! \u2796\n\ud83c\udfa7 The headset I use - https://astro.family/mrdalekjdEMEA\n\nSubscribe for more videos!\n- MrDalekJD\n\nBusiness Enquiries: business@mrdalekjd.com\n\nLet's keep the comment section AWESOME to make sure everyone has a good time!

                    "description": "The First Official Black Ops 7 Zombies Teaser is HERE - BO7 Zombies Marketing Season BEGINS!\n\u25baIf you enjoyed this video, consider hitting \ud83d\udc4d LIKE and \u2705 Subscribe for more!\n\u25baWhat do YOU think of this teaser in the comments below?\n\nToday Treyarch gave us the FIRST official teaser for Black Ops 7 Zombies. The teaser involves a clip of a compass magnet going haywire with the caption \"Every direction leads to d***th\" with the hashtag Zombies, insinuating this is a teaser tied to Black Ops 7 Zombies. The connections to this teaser include the Bermuda Triangle and the similarity to the compass behaviour. Could this be an indication of some map mechanics that might be in the Black Ops 7 Zombies launch map? There are also jumper cables usually associated with vehicles. Maybe the Wonder Vehicle requires parts in order to power it on and use? \n\n\u2796 Follow me! \u2796\n\ud83d\udc25 Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/MrDalekJD\n\ud83d\udcd8 Facebook - http://facebook.com/MrDalekJD\n\ud83c\udfa5 TikTok - http://www.tiktok.com/@dalekjd \n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram - http://instagram.com/MrDalekJD\n\ud83d\udea8Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmn6qb15MOEDxa8DyqxIzhQ\n\ud83d\udc7e Join the MrDalekJD Discord - https://discord.gg/Wc28nWzkmB\n\n\u2796 The equipment I use! \u2796\n\ud83c\udfa7 The headset I use - https://astro.family/mrdalekjdEMEA\n\nSubscribe for more videos!\n- MrDalekJD\n\nBusiness Enquiries: business@mrdalekjd.com\n\nLet's keep the comment section AWESOME to make sure everyone has a good time!
