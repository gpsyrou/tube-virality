ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn"

                "description": "#CupofJoe #MultoStrippedDown #VivaRecords\nThe Loved One (Original Movie Soundtrack) serves as a deeply felt musical companion to the much-anticipated comeback film of Anne Curtis and Jericho Rosales, marking their return to the big screen together under the direction of acclaimed filmmaker Irene Villamor. Anchored by Cup of Joe\u2019s Stripped Down Version of \u201cMulto,\u201d the OST opens with an intimate reimagining that strips the song to its emotional core: quiet, vulnerable, and aching with unspoken love. Kyle Raphael\u2019s \u201cLibu-Libong Buwan (Uuwian)\u201d follows as a tender vow of return, echoing the film\u2019s themes of distance, patience, and enduring devotion. Another Cup of Joe hit \u201cTingin,\u201d featuring Janine Te\u00f1oso, adds warmth and longing, capturing the fragile moments where love is felt more in silence than in words. Closing the soundtrack is the original version of \u201cMulto,\u201d grounding the collection in Cup of Joe\u2019s signature melancholic storytelling. Together, these tracks shape The Loved One into a poignant soundscape of a lost and found love that continues to haunt the heart.\n\nComposed by Raphaell Ridao, Redentor Immanuel Ridao\nPublished by Viva Music Publishing, Inc.\nProduced by Shadiel Chan, Ken Jezer Umahon, Abner Badua\nArranged by Shadiel Chan, Ken Jezer Umahon, Abner Badua\nRecording Engineer:  Shadiel Chan\nMixed and Mastered by Shadiel Chan\nVocal Engineer: John Cruspero\nCourtesy of Viva Records Corporation\n\n\nLYRICS:\nHumingang malalim\nPumikit na muna\nAt baka sakaling\nNamamalikmata lang\n\nBa\u2019t nababahala\n\u2018Di ba\u2019t ako\u2019y mag-isa\nKala ko\u2019y payapa\nBoses mo\u2019y tumatawag pa\n\nBinaon naman na ang lahat\nTinakpan naman na \u2018king sugat\nNgunit ba\u2019t ba andito pa rin\nHirap na \u2018kong intindihin\n\nTanging panalangin\nLubayan na sana\nDahil sa bawat tingin\nMukha mo\u2019y nakikita\n\nKahit sa\u2019n man mapunta ay\nAnino mo\u2019y kumakapit sa \u2018king kamay\nAko ay dahan-dahang\nNililibing nang buhay pa\n\nHindi na makalaya\nDinadalaw mo \u2018ko bawat gabi\nWala mang nakikita\nHaplos mo\u2019y ramdam pa rin sa dilim\n\nHindi na nananaginip\nHindi na ma-makagising\nPasindi na ng ilaw\nMinumulto na \u2018ko ng damdamin ko\nNg damdamin ko\nNg damdamin ko\n\nHindi mo ba ako lilisanin\nHindi pa ba sapat pagpapahirap sa \u2018kin\nHindi na ba ma-mamayapa\nHindi na ba ma-mamayapa\n\nHindi na makalaya\nDinadalaw mo \u2018ko bawat gabi\nWala mang nakikita\nHaplos mo\u2019y ramdam pa rin sa dilim\n\nHindi na nananaginip\nHindi na ma-makagising\nPasindi na ng ilaw\nMinumulto na \u2018ko ng damdamin ko\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nFor artist bookings and inquiries:\nContact 0998-5753307 or email us at vivamusicbookings@viva.com.ph\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more exclusive videos: http://bit.ly/VivaRecordsYT\u200b\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vivarecords\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/viva_records\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/viva_records\u200b\nTiktok: @viva_records\nSpotify: VIVA RECORDS\nSnapchat: Viva Records",

Kyle Raphael\u2019s \u201cLibu-Libong Buwan (Uuwian)\u201d follows as a tender vow of return, echoing the film\u2019s themes of distance, patience, and enduring devotion. Another Cup of Joe hit \u201cTingin,\u201d featuring Janine Te\u00f1oso, adds warmth and longing, capturing the fragile moments where love is felt more in silence than in words. Closing the soundtrack is the original version of \u201cMulto,\u201d grounding the collection in Cup of Joe\u2019s signature melancholic storytelling. Together, these tracks shape The Loved One into a poignant soundscape of a lost and found love that continues to haunt the heart.\n\nComposed by Raphaell Ridao, Redentor Immanuel Ridao\nPublished by Viva Music Publishing, Inc.\nProduced by Shadiel Chan, Ken Jezer Umahon, Abner Badua\nArranged by Shadiel Chan, Ken Jezer Umahon, Abner Badua\nRecording Engineer:  Shadiel Chan\nMixed and Mastered by Shadiel Chan\nVocal Engineer: John Cruspero\nCourtesy of Viva Records Corporation\n\n\nLYRICS:\nHumingang malalim\nPumikit na muna\nAt baka sakaling\nNamamalikmata lang\n\nBa\u2019t nababahala\n\u2018Di ba\u2019t ako\u2019y mag-isa\nKala ko\u2019y payapa\nBoses mo\u2019y tumatawag pa\n\nBinaon naman na ang lahat\nTinakpan naman na \u2018king sugat\nNgunit ba\u2019t ba andito pa rin\nHirap na \u2018kong intindihin\n\nTanging panalangin\nLubayan na sana\nDahil sa bawat tingin\nMukha mo\u2019y nakikita\n\nKahit sa\u2019n man mapunta ay\nAnino mo\u2019y kumakapit sa \u2018king kamay\nAko ay dahan-dahang\nNililibing nang buhay pa\n\nHindi na makalaya\nDinadalaw mo \u2018ko bawat gabi\nWala mang nakikita\nHaplos mo\u2019y ramdam pa rin sa dilim\n\nHindi na nananaginip\nHindi na ma-makagising\nPasindi na ng ilaw\nMinumulto na \u2018ko ng damdamin ko\nNg damdamin ko\nNg damdamin ko\n\nHindi mo ba ako lilisanin\nHindi pa ba sapat pagpapahirap sa \u2018kin\nHindi na ba ma-mamayapa\nHindi na ba ma-mamayapa\n\nHindi na makalaya\nDinadalaw mo \u2018ko bawat gabi\nWala mang nakikita\nHaplos mo\u2019y ramdam pa rin sa dilim\n\nHindi na nananaginip\nHindi na ma-makagising\nPasindi na ng ilaw\nMinumulto na \u2018ko ng damdamin ko\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nFor artist bookings and inquiries:\nContact 0998-5753307 or email us at vivamusicbookings@viva.com.ph\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more exclusive videos: http://bit.ly/VivaRecordsYT\u200b\n\nFollow us on:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vivarecords\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/viva_records\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/viva_records\u200b\nTiktok: @viva_records\nSpotify: VIVA RECORDS\nSnapchat: Viva Records"
