ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

Get it now: \nhttps://ifeeltheeverblackfesteringwithinme.com/\nhttps://lornashoreband.com/\n\n\"This song has been a very long-time coming for me. In my teens, my father and I never had a great relationship. We\u2019ve had countless fallouts and it got to the point where we hadn\u2019t spoken to each other in many, many years. I\u2019d written songs in my teens and early 20\u2019s about him and my frustration but nothing really helped fill the hole I felt inside. There were just too many mixed emotions. As time went on, I came to realize that, despite my anger, all I ever really wanted was to go back to the home I grew up in. For that reason, I decided to knock on his door and try one more time to get in touch with him.\n\nThe day I saw my father (for the first time in who knows how long), I quickly realized something. He wasn't the same person I remembered. He\u2019d aged, had wrinkles, and a full-head of white hair. The tree that I remembered growing up next to was gone. The house inside was the same as I remembered but\u2026 older\u2026 dustier; and it felt\u2026 strange. As time seems to fly by for me, it also does for my father. And in all my parting, I never stopped to think about how much time actually went by. I spent my youth being so prideful and stubborn. I never even considered that as I was aging, so was he. I\u2019ve had countless chances to fix things but wasn\u2019t brave enough to actually do it. And now, I will never be able to get that time back.\nMy house wasn\u2019t the same, my father wasn\u2019t the same. And sure enough, I wasn\u2019t the same either.\n\nI wanted to capture that feeling when I wrote this song. It was so incredibly bittersweet and took a lot of courage for me. On one hand, I am so happy that I was able to make amends, on the other, I was so upset that it took me as long as it did.\n\n\u2018Glenwood Ave\u2019 was the name of the street I grew up on. I remember my father always telling me, \u201cI\u2019m the tree, you\u2019re the branch.\u201d The references to the oak tree missing are symbolic for the relationship and time we lost together. To be honest, there are countless references in this song that only the people who knew me growing up would understand. As you can imagine, this song is one I hold very near and dear to me.\n\nMy only hope is that when people hear \u201cGlenwood\u201d, they can think about their own lives and the people they\u2019ve pushed away and ask themselves, \u201cis it really worth being upset for this long?\u201d Time is constantly fleeting, just as we are as well. I believe all we really want is to go back to that special place \u2013 a place where nostalgia triumphs over trauma; a place that we can call home. - WILL RAMOS\n\nLYRICS //\n\nCAN WE GO BACK TO HOW IT USED TO BE\nCAN WE GO BACK\nIT\u2019LL NEVER BE THE SAME FOR ME\nWALKING THROUGH MEMORIES\nTHESE FADING PHOTOGRAPHS TELL STORIES OF ANOTHER TIME\nFORGOTTEN ELEGIES\nTHESE TINSEL DREAMS PAVED THE MOMENTS THAT MADE UP MY LIFE\nWHERE DO THEY GO?\nWHAT DO WE SEEK?\nAS WE GROW OLDER SO DO THE TREES\nTHIS AGING OAK NEVER FELT SO COLD\nIT ROTS WITHIN LOOKING BACK ON WHAT COULD\u2019VE BEEN\nTHE LEAVES BEGIN TO FALL ALL AROUND ME\n\nTAKE ME HOME\nTHIS PAIN IS ALL I KNOW\nI SEE YOUR FACE IN A BROKEN HOME\nWE COULDN\u2019T SEE THE FOREST LIES WITHIN THE TREES\nWHERE DID IT GO\nWE CAN\u2019T GO BACK TO HOW IT USED TO BE\nWE CAN\u2019T GO BACK\nIT\u2019LL NEVER BE THE SAME FOR ME\nCUZ THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW\nIT\u2019S NOT THE SAME\nALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS NOW ONLY BRING ME PAIN\nAS IT ALL TURNS TO DUST, WE\u2019RE SLOWLY TAKEN BY TIME\nLET\u2019S REWIND\nWHERE DID IT GO?\nWHEN DID IT LEAVE?\nYOU CUT ME DOWN AND I RAN AWAY\nYOU WERE THE TREE FROM WHICH I GREW\nI WAS THE BRANCH YOU NEVER KNEW\n\nTAKE ME HOME\nTHIS PAIN IS ALL I KNOW\nI SEE YOUR FACE IN A BROKEN HOME\nWE COULDN\u2019T SEE THE FOREST LIES WITHIN THE TREES\nWHERE DID IT GO \nWHERE DID IT GO \nARE WE TOO FAR GONE\nFROM WHERE WE BEGAN\nALL THE TIME WE LOST\nTHE YEARS WE SPENT\nRUNNING AWAY - WE HIDE\nI GUESS WE COULD SAY OUR PRIDE GOT IN THE WAY\nWE\u2019VE BEEN LOST IN THE WRONG MOMENT\n\nTAKE ME HOME\nTHIS PAIN IS ALL I KNOW\nI SEE YOUR FACE IN A BROKEN HOME\nWE COULDN\u2019T SEE THE FOREST LIES WITHIN THE TREES\nWHERE DID IT GO\n\n////\n\nPRODUCTION\u00a0\nProduction Company -\u00a0Versa Films x Midvessel\u00a0\nDirector - Dylan Hryciuk\nProducer - Paul Henon\n\nCAST\nPast Mother - Kathryn Wylde\nPast Father - Ashar Usman\nPresent Father \u2013 Will Ramos Sr.\nTeen Will - Jude Acosta\nYoung Will - Liam Ladi\nStoner Friend - Cooper Caruso\nClassroom Extras:\nDylan Hall\nJase Eckert\nMickie Ye\nDwane Lee\n\nCREW\nWriters \u2013 Dylan Hryciuk & Will Ramos\nDirector of Photography - Jeremy Ratzlaff\n1st AC - David Darlington\nSteadicam - Douglas Lau\nGaffer - Nick Henon\nKey Grip - David Luna\n1st AD - Matthew Kalapuch\nProduction Designer - Nick Castagna\nArt Assist - Dylan Brown\nLocation Supervisor - D\u2019Netra Celeste\nH/MU - Eloria Cook\nPA - Trey Egert\nPA - Oliver Pippin\nPA - Roy Xu\nEQ - Lightbulb Rentals\nEditor - Dylan Hryciuk\nPost-Sound \u2013 Brent Blazieko\nVFX \u2013 Frank Hyland\n\nProduced by\nJosh Schroeder\n\n#lornashore #deathcore",

Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."
