This is Finding the Tomb of the Minecraft Mafia.\n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable SMP series, where he is escaping Paragon / Proton: Minecraft's Most Secure Prison, or got hunted by a Minecraft Player who doesn't exist. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video: @TheobaldTheBird @Marlowww @RasplinYT @CoinMonkeExtras @Venpu @Willerhide herobanenair pro4d @TomLWSMC @qCxsh @NotBlueLeaf @Kibaxmc @nezoshoki \n\nOriginal Music: @tsynphonia \n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy!"

It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d).
