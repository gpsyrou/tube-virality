Are you sad?\nAre you always gonna hate me for that night in Tokyo? \nWhen it ended \nI kinda hoped that it\u2019d be open ended\nBut you never looked back \nWell I guess you can\u2019t hold on to something once you let it go \nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI guess that I\u2019m taking what I can get \n\u2018Cause I don\u2019t get nothing new from your friends \nIf you got the harder side of the break \nThen why is it harder for me to take \nThere\u2019s so much I might never get to say, ay\nBut I know a place \nWhere we can be us\nI know it ain\u2019t real \nBut it\u2019s real enough \nFrom sun going down to sun coming up \nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is all that we\u2019ll ever be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nAt least a girl can dream \nI-I-I know it\u2019s only in my mind\nPlaying three nights on the stereo\nLike a movie scene, DiCaprio \nOh l-I-I put my make up on just to fall asleep\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re here with me \nWhenever I close my eyes\nIt\u2019s taking me back in time\nBeen drowning in dreams lately \nLike it\u2019s 2019 baby \nWhenever I\u2019m missing you \nCall you up but I can\u2019t get through\nDon\u2019t know where you sleep lately \nBut I\u2019ll see you in my dreams maybe \nWe can catch up, drive down our old street\nIf all that we were is something we\u2019ll never be\nIt\u2019s bittersweet\nCan we be friends at least\n\nCredits:\nStarring.\nLalisa Manobal\nKentaro Sakaguchi\n\nA film by ARFILM @arfilm_ojun\nWritten & Directed by OJun Kwon\n\nAssistant Director.

                "description": "Check out the creepy trailer for GOOD BOY, an upcoming horror thriller movie starring Indy the Dog, Shane Jensen, Arielle Friedman, and Larry Fessenden.\n\nOur canine hero, Indy, finds himself on a new adventure with his human owner\u2014and best friend\u2014Todd, leaving city life for a long-vacant family home in the country. From the start, two things are abundantly clear: Indy is wary of the creepy old house, and his affection for Todd is unwavering. After moving in, Indy is immediately vexed by empty corners, tracks an invisible presence only he can see, perceives phantasmagoric warnings from a long-dead dog, and is haunted by visions of the previous occupant\u2019s grim death. When Todd begins succumbing to the dark forces swirling around the house, Indy must battle a malevolence intent on dragging his beloved Todd into the afterlife.\n\nGood Boy is produced by Ben Leonberg and Kari Fischer. It is written by Alex Cannon and Ben Leonberg.\n\nGood Boy, directed by Ben Leonberg, opens in North American theaters on October 3, 2025 and opens in the UK on October 10, 2025.\n\n#GoodBoy #Movies #IGN",

Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",

                    "description": "Today I spent all my robux to get the new princess thorn in Grow A Garden! Make sure you watch the whole video to find out what happens. \n\nFOLTYN MERCH: https://foltyn.shop/\n\n--Socials--\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/hqwZhrkqRr\n\nRoblox Group: https://www.roblox.com/groups/1177555...\n\nRoblox Name: TheRealFoltyn\n\nInsta: https://www.instagram.com/foltynn/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Foltynnn\n\nWhat is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms."
