For tour dates visit: http://www.andrerieu.com/tour\n\nORIGINAL LYRICS | Let it Go\nThe snow glows white on the mountain tonight\nNot a footprint to be seen\nA kingdom of isolation\nAnd it looks like I'm the queen\nThe wind is howling like this swirling storm inside\nCouldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried\nDon't let them in, don't let them see\nBe the good girl you always have to be\nConceal, don't feel, don't let them know\nWell, now they know\n\nLet it go, let it go\nCan't hold it back anymore\nLet it go, let it go\nTurn away and slam the door\nI don't care what they're going to say\n\nLet the storm rage on\nThe cold never bothered me anyway\nIt's funny how some distance makes everything seem small\nAnd the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all\nIt's time to see what I can do\nTo test the limits and break through\nNo right, no wrong, no rules for me\nI'm free\n\nLet it go, let it go\nI am one with the wind and sky\nLet it go, let it go\nYou'll never see me cry\n\nHere I stand and here I stay\nLet the storm rage on\nMy power flurries through the air into the ground\nMy soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around\nAnd one thought crystallizes like an icy blast\nI'm never going back, the past is in the past\n\nLet it go, let it go\nAnd I'll rise like the break of dawn\nLet it go, let it go\nThat perfect girl is gone\nHere I stand in the light of day\n\nLet the storm rage on\nThe cold never bothered me anyway\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nSubscribe to the Andr\u00e9 Rieu Newsletter:\nhttps://confirmsubscription.com/h/d/BB9CC3EFB24CE769\n\nSubscribe to Andr\u00e9 Rieu's YouTube channel at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AndreRieuTV?sub_confirmation=1\n\nOr follow Andr\u00e9 Rieu at:\nhttps://instagram.com/andrerieu\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@andrerieu\nhttp://www.facebook.com/andrerieu\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n\u00a9 2025 -- Andr\u00e9 Rieu Productions | www.andrerieu.com",

And every subscriber gained = 10p to charity.\n\nHelp me support Action for Children:\n\n4.5 million UK children now live in poverty and for many, Christmas is anything but magical. No stockings. No presents. No festive food - often no food at all.\n\nBut you could help change that.\n\nBecome a Secret Santa by donating to Action for Children, and you could help a vulnerable child feel the magic of Christmas.\n\nJoin me in donating to Action for Children and you could bring back the magic. You could give the essentials of warm clothes, a hot meal, or a Christmas present for a child who wouldn\u2019t otherwise get one.\n\nChildren across the UK need a Secret Santa like you.\n\nSubscribe, donate, share\u2026\n\nEdited by Cal: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/cal.vain/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@UC8psAJ4pVUQQq-tCa11cNaw \n\n#italianbach #funny #commentary"

                "description": "\u2014 Attention Viewers \u26a0\ufe0f\n\u2014 This is a Fan-Made Concept Trailer for:\n\u2014 Avengers: Doomsday - The X-Men Will Return\n\n\u2014 This video is a fan-made concept trailer, created solely for artistic and entertainment purposes.The goal behind this trailer is to showcase my creativity and storytelling skills through a concept trailer based on a unique and original idea. By combining various effects, sound design, and AI technologies, I\u2019ve crafted a cinematic experience that reimagines familiar worlds in bold and imaginative ways. This trailer is not official and is intended to entertain, inspire, and engage with the YouTube community. Thank you for your support \u2014 now let\u2019s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. \ud83c\udfac\u2728\n\n\u2014 In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story shifts toward a devastated corner of the multiverse where the original X-Men face the consequences of a war they were never meant to win. With their world collapsing under the rise of Sentinels and humanity\u2019s fear reaching its final conclusion, Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr confront the reality that their lifelong struggle has reached its end, not in conflict, but in shared understanding. As Magneto reflects on mortality and identity in the face of extinction, the narrative positions the X-Men\u2019s fate as a warning rather than a spectacle, suggesting their reality has already crossed a point of no return. Cyclops emerges as the last line of resistance in a doomed timeline, embodying both defiance and inevitability as the cost of survival becomes clear. This chapter frames the X-Men not as saviors, but as casualties of a broken future, setting the stage for Avengers: Doomsday as a story about legacy, sacrifice, and the irreversible consequences of choices made across worlds.\n\n\u2014  Subscribe to Teaser Universe \ud83c\udfac\n\u2014  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com \ud83d\udce9\n\n#doomsday #avengers #marvel \n\navengers doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday trailer xmen,avengers doomsday trailer leak,x men trailer,x men trailer leak,x men trailer of doomsday,doomsday x men teaser,doomsday x men teaser leak,doomsday x men trailer,avengers doomsday x men trailer,doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday marvel trailer,x men avengers doomsday trailer leak,doomsday trailer 3,doomsday thor trailer,doomsday thor teaser,doomsday thor leaked trailer,doomsday official trailer,doomsday",

                    "description": "\u2014 Attention Viewers \u26a0\ufe0f\n\u2014 This is a Fan-Made Concept Trailer for:\n\u2014 Avengers: Doomsday - The X-Men Will Return\n\n\u2014 This video is a fan-made concept trailer, created solely for artistic and entertainment purposes.The goal behind this trailer is to showcase my creativity and storytelling skills through a concept trailer based on a unique and original idea. By combining various effects, sound design, and AI technologies, I\u2019ve crafted a cinematic experience that reimagines familiar worlds in bold and imaginative ways. This trailer is not official and is intended to entertain, inspire, and engage with the YouTube community. Thank you for your support \u2014 now let\u2019s dive into a world shaped by creativity and craft. \ud83c\udfac\u2728\n\n\u2014 In this concept trailer for Avengers: Doomsday, the story shifts toward a devastated corner of the multiverse where the original X-Men face the consequences of a war they were never meant to win. With their world collapsing under the rise of Sentinels and humanity\u2019s fear reaching its final conclusion, Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr confront the reality that their lifelong struggle has reached its end, not in conflict, but in shared understanding. As Magneto reflects on mortality and identity in the face of extinction, the narrative positions the X-Men\u2019s fate as a warning rather than a spectacle, suggesting their reality has already crossed a point of no return. Cyclops emerges as the last line of resistance in a doomed timeline, embodying both defiance and inevitability as the cost of survival becomes clear. This chapter frames the X-Men not as saviors, but as casualties of a broken future, setting the stage for Avengers: Doomsday as a story about legacy, sacrifice, and the irreversible consequences of choices made across worlds.\n\n\u2014  Subscribe to Teaser Universe \ud83c\udfac\n\u2014  For inquiries: teaseruniverse@gmail.com \ud83d\udce9\n\n#doomsday #avengers #marvel \n\navengers doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday trailer xmen,avengers doomsday trailer leak,x men trailer,x men trailer leak,x men trailer of doomsday,doomsday x men teaser,doomsday x men teaser leak,doomsday x men trailer,avengers doomsday x men trailer,doomsday trailer,avengers doomsday marvel trailer,x men avengers doomsday trailer leak,doomsday trailer 3,doomsday thor trailer,doomsday thor teaser,doomsday thor leaked trailer,doomsday official trailer,doomsday"

This concept trailer brings Sylvester Stallone back to the ring one final time alongside Michael B. Jordan as Adonis Creed in a story about legacy, sacrifice, and what it truly means to go the distance. When an unexpected challenge forces Rocky to lace up the gloves again, he must decide whether the glory is worth the cost or if some battles are better left to the next generation. The bell rings, the crowd roars, and Philadelphia watches as legends are made and broken in the same breath.\nWe crafted this trailer to capture that raw emotion and grit that turned a underdog story into a cultural phenomenon spanning five decades. Stallone delivers the heart while Jordan brings the fire in a mentor-student dynamic that hits harder than any punch ever could.

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It\u2019s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX \u2014 interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything \u2014 be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (\u201cRobux\u201d). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",
