June 27.\nOnly on Netflix.\n\nMore info on Squid Game Season 3:\nA failed rebellion, the death of a friend, and a secret betrayal. Picking up in the aftermath of Season 2\u2019s bloody cliffhanger, the third and final season of Netflix\u2019s most popular series finds Gi-hun, a.k.a. Player 456, at his lowest point yet. But the Squid Game stops for no one, so Gi-hun will be forced to make some important choices in the face of overwhelming despair as he and the surviving players are thrust into deadlier games that test everyone\u2019s resolve. With each round, their choices lead to increasingly grave consequences. Meanwhile, In-ho resumes his role as Front Man to welcome the mysterious VIPs, and his brother Jun-ho continues his search for the elusive island, unaware there\u2019s a traitor in their midst. Will Gi-hun make the right decisions, or will Front Man finally break his spirit?\nDirector Hwang Dong-hyuk, who made history at the 74th Primetime Emmys\u00ae, becoming the first Asian to win Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series, once again helms the series as director, writer, and producer.

                "description": "In a spectacular military and propganda coup, Ukraine has carried out an audacious attack on Russia\u2019s airforce, using drones to destroy as many as 40 warplanes at military bases across the country.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said 117 drones were used in the so-called \"Spider's Web\" operation by the SBU security service.  They were smuggled into Russia hidden in wooden mobile cabins, moved close to the airbases, then launched by remote control.  Ukrainian sources told BBC News it had taken 18 months to plan and carry out the operation. \n\nRussia confirmed the Ukrainian attacks, calling them a \"terrorist act\".   Ukraine claims it caused $7bn in damage and destroyed many of Russia\u2019s strategic bomber aircraft. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Paul Adams and Ellie Price.

                "description": "In his ring return, Charlo dominated throughout, showing off his trademark jab early and often (44 total jabs landed), while peppering in straight right hands and left hooks off his signature punch. Charlo scored his first of three knockdowns in round three, hurting LaManna with a straight right before sending him down with a left hook.\n \nThe Houston-native struck again in round four, landing another left hook that forced LaManna to buckle and take a knee. While referee Mark Nelson originally ruled no knockdown, that decision was overturned on video review between rounds.\n \nCharlo returned to his dominance in the fifth frame, this time delivering a laser right hand that put LaManna down for the third time. Although LaManna was able to make it to the bell, he was worse for wear, leading to the referee stopping the bout on advice from the ringside physician.  \n \n\"I'm just looking to stay well-known and relevant,\u201d said Charlo. \u201cNo more dark places and keep my head straight. I just want to encourage everyone in the world, keep God first, keep God first.\u201d\n \n\"It is what it is, I did the best I could,\u201d said LaManna. \u201cThe doctors are here for a reason and they made their decision. I'm disappointed, but it's boxing\u2026Charlo was sharper than I expected. I expected him to come out guns blazing a little more. He's a two-time world champion for a reason. He has a great, heavy jab and he did what he had to do.\"\n\n#CharloLaManna #JermallCharlo #Boxing \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions",

Although LaManna was able to make it to the bell, he was worse for wear, leading to the referee stopping the bout on advice from the ringside physician.  \n \n\"I'm just looking to stay well-known and relevant,\u201d said Charlo. \u201cNo more dark places and keep my head straight. I just want to encourage everyone in the world, keep God first, keep God first.\u201d\n \n\"It is what it is, I did the best I could,\u201d said LaManna. \u201cThe doctors are here for a reason and they made their decision. I'm disappointed, but it's boxing\u2026Charlo was sharper than I expected. I expected him to come out guns blazing a little more. He's a two-time world champion for a reason. He has a great, heavy jab and he did what he had to do.\"\n\n#CharloLaManna #JermallCharlo #Boxing \n\nVisit PremierBoxingChampions.com for more info.\n\nSIGN UP FOR FIGHT ALERTS: \n\nhttps://pbcham.ps/FightAlerts\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/premierboxing\nhttps://instagram.com/premierboxing\nhttps://www.facebook.com/premierboxingchampions"
