        "description": "We've had booing during anthems at NHL games and other sporting events for weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face-off. One part in a political landscape between the USA and Canada at the moment that has ignited this age old rivalry to a level I haven't seen in years. It all came to a head tonight in Montreal as team USA faced off against team Canada in what was absolute chaos in the opening seconds. Truly a game that will be talked about for decades! This game did not disappoint. We saw 3 scraps in the first 11 seconds as Matthew Tkachuk and Brandon Hagel went at it, then Brady Tkachuk and Sam Bennet followed by a 3rd between JT Miller and Colton Parayko. The Bell Centre erupted after McDavid opened the scoring shortly after in a first period I can't remember anything like. We had massive hits, fast paced hockey and a reminder of what we've been missing for nearly a decade! From start to finish, this was old time hockey and I loved every second of it. I cover it all in todays NHL video!",

I'm a Minecraft channel though, so of course we had to make it unique.\n\nWe coded a mod that makes it so you can scan things from real life into Minecraft. Of course the first thing we did with this mod was scan our ENTIRE HOUSE into Minecraft! We did this on Minecraft 1.21.4, but it's possible on basically any version! 1.8, 1.20, etc. The mod is called BlockPrintr.\n\nThis video is a mix of IRL vlog style content, and in game Minecraft content. Both showing off the house. We toured Sapnap's office and room, George's office and room, and the rest of the house!\n\nThank you guys for all of the love and support! Lots more cool stuff to come, another Titan Minecraft Manhunt is hopefully the next video! Comment down below ideas :)",

        "description": "Super Bowl LIX is in the books. The Philadelphia Eagles are world champions. And Philly didn't just win vs the Kansas City Chiefs, it was unlike anything we've seen in Super Bowl history for many different reasons.\n\nJalen Hurts put up one of the greatest performances football has seen. Between the adjustments made due to the Chiefs intentions to stop Saquon Barkley, utilizing skill positions like AJ Brown, Devonta Smith, Dallas Goedert, Jahan Dotson, etc, Nick Sirianni and Kellen Moore did wonders against Steve Spagnuolo's Chiefs defense. And that includes the work from the offensive line in Lane Johnson, Mekhi Becton, and Jordan Mailata.\n\nThen in terms of the Eagles defense, you could argue this was even more dominant of a showing. Josh Sweat, Jalen Carter, Milton Williams, Nolan Smith, Zack Baun, Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell, you name it, the entire unit of Vic Fangio's had one of the best games ever seen on the biggest stage. And ultimately, it was a victory we won't soon forget in the fashion it occurred.\n\nAlso, give me ideas for other NFL videos, news, and discussions I should cover in the future. I read ALL comments.\n\nThank you so much for the support guys.\n\nMY NBA CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/c/HoopsDigest\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thehoopsdigest\nTIKTOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@hoopsdigest?l...\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

Rihanna, Usher, Justin Timberlake, Prince, and so many others have brought us halftime shows that reminded us of their hits like Diamonds, U Got It Bad, SexyBack, and Purple Rain. \n\nKendrick chose to do something different and that’s why we’re obsessed.\n\nIf you love my stories I have a podcast that comes out every week: https://bit.ly/3NQmpio \n\nHit me on them internets: \nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy \nTikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@joshjohnsoncomedy \nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy Video \n\nRecorded at The Orange Peel in Asheville, NC",

        "description": "A Delta Air Lines jet flipped on its roof while landing Monday at Toronto’s Pearson Airport, but all 80 people on board survived and those hurt had relatively minor injuries, the airport’s chief executive said.\r\n\r\nSnow was being blown by winds gusting to 40 mph (65 kph) when the flight from Minneapolis carrying 76 passengers and four crew attempted to land at around 2:15 p.m. Communications between the tower and pilot were normal on approach and it's not clear what went so drastically wrong when the plane touched down.\r\n\r\nCanadian authorities held two brief news conferences but provided no details on the crash. Video posted to social media only showed the aftermath with the Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR overturned, the fuselage seemingly intact and firefighters dousing what was left of the fire as passengers climbed out and walked across the tarmac.\r\n\r\n“We are very grateful there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries,” Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told reporters.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE: https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/nation-world/delta-flight-toronto-airport-incident/507-81c8b0f2-16fa-4371-9ef5-2d9933d96952 --\n\nAt 3News, we’re not here to tell you the news, we’re here to share the stories that you say matter most to you.

Use code BLACKTAIL at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: http://incogni.com/blacktail\n\nUPDATE: I now have evidence that the scammer I have been talking to is the same person(s) that scammed Teresa in this video. After giving her the table she posted the three of us with the table on Facebook. Shortly after, my scammer sent me her Facebook photo and said that was the table he built for me. So there would only be one reason a random scammer would follow a random lady in Iowa.
